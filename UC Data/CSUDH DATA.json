We Want to Hear from You Dining is central to the student experience, and these services help to contribute to student learning and success. ​ CSUDH recognizes that there has been concern about the new dining services contract with Aramark. Aramark’s contract with Toro Auxiliary Partners includes key performance indicators (KPIs) that they must meet related to food quality, safe working conditions, student employment and engagement, and innovation in hospitality. Foundation is committed to ensuring these KPIs are met. ​ The primary venue for providing suggestions and feedback on Urban Mosaic Food Company’s dining program, food quality, and customer service is through their satisfaction survey here: www.yourdiningvoice.com . ​ Both Aramark and Foundation staff review submissions daily. 01 Why Aramark? In 2020, Toro Auxiliary Partners engaged in a campus hospitality assessment of the university’s dining needs and its existing in-house dining operation model. The independent assessment’s recommendation included contracting all dining on campus to an outside partner to ensure greater financial stability and greater scalability of services. In 2021, CSUDH Toro Auxiliary Partners began a request for proposal (RFP) process to evaluate bids from food service management companies, with the aim to support the university’s infrastructure growth. View the released Request for Proposal here [PDF] . A committee that included Toro Auxiliary Partners and university staff, faculty, and students was formed to select what company would become the university’s dining vendor. Of the proposals, Aramark was the most thorough and competitive based on the scoring metrics, and the committee recommended that CSUDH accept the bid. ​ Aramark Sustainability Initiatives Aramark will continue CSUDH’s commitment to sustainable dining practices and has developed and implemented Green Thread, which minimizes food waste, conserves natural resources, and sources ingredients responsibly.

Institutions or accrediting bodies that do not undergo such rigorous review are often termed \"degree mills\" or \"accreditation mills\", and the certificates and degrees offered may be of dubious quality or even bogus. As the CHEA website states, \"Degree mills and accreditation mills mislead and harm. In the United States, degrees and certificates from mills may not be acknowledged by other institutions when students seek to transfer or go to graduate school. Employers may not acknowledge degrees and certificates from degree mills when providing tuition assistance for continuing education. 'Accreditation' from an accreditation mill can mislead students and the public about the quality of an institution. In the presence of degree mills and accreditation mills, students may spend a good deal of money and receive neither an education nor a useable credential.\" To verify that a program is NAACLS Accredited, please go to our Find a Program page. For more information on degree mills or accreditation mills, please refer to the following websites: chea.org/degreemills www2.ed.gov/students/prep/college/diplomamills/diploma-mills.html We're Committed The National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) is committed to being the premier international agency for accreditation of educational programs in the clinical laboratory sciences and related health professions through the involvement of expert volunteers and its dedication to public service.

Dining at CSUDH Join Us for a Bite to Eat ​ CSUDH’s Campus Dining Services is now Urban Mosaic Food Company, operated by Aramark. ​ Committed to providing CSUDH students, faculty, and staff with convenient and healthy food choices while on campus, Urban Mosaic Food Company offers a variety of locations throughout campus for you to enjoy a sit-down meal, a sandwich on the go, or a cup of coffee on the way to class. ​ For locations, menus, and hours of operation, please visit the Dining Locations and Menu page. We Want to Hear from You Dining is central to the student experience, and these services help to contribute to student learning and success. ​ CSUDH recognizes that there has been concern about the new dining services contract with Aramark. Aramark’s contract with Toro Auxiliary Partners includes key performance indicators (KPIs) that they must meet related to food quality, safe working conditions, student employment and engagement, and innovation in hospitality. Foundation is committed to ensuring these KPIs are met. ​ The primary venue for providing suggestions and feedback on Urban Mosaic Food Company’s dining program, food quality, and customer service is through their satisfaction survey here: www.yourdiningvoice.com . ​ Both Aramark and Foundation staff review submissions daily. 01 Why Aramark? In 2020, Toro Auxiliary Partners engaged in a campus hospitality assessment of the university’s dining needs and its existing in-house dining operation model. The independent assessment’s recommendation included contracting all dining on campus to an outside partner to ensure greater financial stability and greater scalability of services. In 2021, CSUDH Toro Auxiliary Partners began a request for proposal (RFP) process to evaluate bids from food service management companies, with the aim to support the university’s infrastructure growth. View the released Request for Proposal here [PDF] . A committee that included Toro Auxiliary Partners and university staff, faculty, and students was formed to select what company would become the university’s dining vendor. Of the proposals, Aramark was the most thorough and competitive based on the scoring metrics, and the committee recommended that CSUDH accept the bid. ​ Aramark Sustainability Initiatives Aramark will continue CSUDH’s commitment to sustainable dining practices and has developed and implemented Green Thread, which minimizes food waste, conserves natural resources, and sources ingredients responsibly. Read more on Aramark’s Sustainability page: https://csudh.campusdish.com/Sustainability 02 Customize Your Meal Experience with DB Dollars New to CSUDH is Urban Mosaic’s Meal Plan and Dining Dollars cards. The Block 25 Meal Plan includes 25 meals plus $150 in Dining Dollars for $310 a semester. Or choose the Dining Dollars (a declining balance card) and load it up in $25 increments, depending on your needs. Dining Dollars can by used by resident and commuter students at Toro Fresh, Café Toro, DH Sports Lounge, Union Grind Coffee, DH Market, DH Express, and Booked & Brewed. You may also use DB Dollars to treat a guest to a meal. ​ It is your responsibility to activate your DB option each academic year with Dining Services to assure meals are accessible at Mosaic Dining Company locations.

Definition of a Representative of Athletics Interests: In general, you are considered a representative of athletics interests (or a booster) if any of the following apply: • You are the parent or legal guardian of an enrolled Cal State Dominguez Hills student-athlete • You are a former student or fan of Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletics; • You are or have been a member of any athletic booster club associated with Cal State Dominguez Hills; • You have participated in promoting the Toro athletics program; • You have assisted in the recruitment of prospects to Cal State Dominguez Hills; • You have made any sort of financial contribution to Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletics. Note: Once you trigger \"booster status\", you will always be considered a booster and held to NCAA rules. Essential Information for Representatives of Athletics Interests: Extra Benefits Definition: An extra benefit is any special arrangement to provide a student-athlete or student-athlete's relative, coach or friend a benefit not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation. Extra benefits for prospects are called offers or inducements and are prohibited. An institution's staff member or any representative of its athletics interests shall not be involved, directly or indirectly, in making arrangements for giving or offering to give any financial aid or other benefits to a prospect or to a prospect's relatives, coach or friends. Examples of prohibited extra benefits include but are not limited to: • Cash or loan in any amount • Gift, clothing or equipment (i.e. holiday gift, birthday present, gift certificate) • Special discount, payment arrangements or free or reduced cost services • The purchase of a meal or service at a commercial establishment • Free or reduced cost rent or housing • Use of a car or other personal property (i.e. house) • Promise of employment after graduation • Employment for a prospect's friends or relatives • Payment of registration fees for athletic camps Recruiting Definition: Recruiting is any solicitation of a prospect or the prospect's family by an institutional staff member or by an institution's representative of athletics interests (i.e. booster) for the purpose of securing that prospect's enrollment and participation in the institution's intercollegiate athletics program NCAA rules restrict the ways that boosters can be involved in the recruiting process.  Below is a breakdown of the do's and don'ts for boosters as it concerns recruiting. Boosters Can: • Observe a PSA's athletic contest, provided there is no contact with the prospect or his/her parents and or relatives • Notify the coaching staff of outstanding prospects in the area • Continue to have normal contact with any neighbor, relative, or family friend that might be a prospect so long as you do not engage in the recruitment process • Refer any and all recruiting questions to an athletic department staff member • Meet with a recruit on the University campus but only at the direction of the Athletics Department Boosters Cannot: • Write or call a prospect or his/her parents or legal guardians • Contact a coach, high school principal, and/or counselor, to evaluate a prospect • Visit a prospect's school to pick up a transcript or video to evaluate his/her academic or athletic ability or to provide to an athletics department staff member • Provide extra benefits to prospects, enrolled college student-athletes or their relatives or friends (e.g. movie or event tickets, dinner, gift cards or special discounts) • Meet with a prospect or his/her immediate family members off campus; or have any recruiting contact unless on the University campus at the direction of the athletics staff • Pay for prospect's registration fees for athletics camps at any time Booster FAQ's 1.     What if a prospect approaches/calls me with questions about playing for Cal State Dominguez Hills? You should not speak with him/her in excess of a friendly greeting and explaining that NCAA rules prohibit you from talking with them further. You can tell them they will need to contact the coach and then take steps to end the conversation. 2.     What if a prospect knows I am a CSUDH graduate and calls me with general questions about the university and its athletic department? If a prospect initiates a phone call to you, a booster, you may answer questions regarding various aspects of attending Cal State Dominguez Hills as long as NO discussion occurs regarding the Cal State Dominguez Hills athletics program. If a prospect asks about Cal Dominguez Hills athletics, you must refer him/her to the appropriate coaching staff member. 3.     May I provide anything to a recruit? No. The NCAA's \"extra benefit\" rule (as defined above) prohibits you from providing any benefit to a prospect or his/her family or friends when the benefit is not available to the general public or all Cal State Dominguez Hills students (e.g. tickets to an athletic, institutional or community event). 4.     If I have family friends with a son or daughter who is a prospect, do the rules change my relationship with them? Not necessarily. The rules are not meant to alter relationships that started for reasons unrelated to athletics, especially prior to an individual reaching such an age or status. You may continue relationships with family friends who have a son or daughter of recruit-able age and is considered a prospect (e.g. backyard BBQs, picnics). But, you cannot encourage the PSA's participation in Cal State Dominguez Hills athletics or provide benefits that you were not providing before he/she became a prospect. 5.     Do the extra benefit rules also apply to enrolled student-athletes and their families and friends? Yes. You are not allowed to provide any benefit or special arrangement to an enrolled student- athlete (e.g. tickets to a sporting event or concert, a meal or snack, an award or gift for athletic performance, special discounts). Again, the rules are not meant to alter pre-existing relationships, but note that the benefits provided must be the type of benefits that you provided prior to the student-athlete's enrollment at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 6.     I am a parent and would like to host my son's team at my home for a meal while they're traveling to our hometown. Is that ok? Yes. Parents of current student-athletes can provide an \"occasional meal\" to their son/daughter's team at any location. Other types of boosters can provide student-athletes with an \"occasional meal\" too, BUT there are restrictions on where they can provide the meal. Boosters can provide student-athletes with a meal in their home, on campus at Cal State Dominguez Hills, or at a facility that is regularly used for home competition. The meal can even be catered but it can only happen \"occasionally\" and with prior-approval from the compliance office. The meal cannot be at a restaurant.

Loker Student Union (LSU) at California State University, Dominguez Hills, was created to serve students and the larger community of CSUDH, with the intent of providing co-curricular education, an environment in which students can develop and call their own. After a student referendum was passed, The California State University began collecting fees for a Student Union building in 1985. This action in conjunction with a campus fundraising campaign entitled FutureNow garnered substantial support for the student union project. In 1989, a ground-breaking ceremony was held and construction of the union facility commenced. Present at the groundbreaking and throughout the life of the project were Donald P. & Katherine B. Loker. Donald Loker, an alumnus of Harvard and Katherine Loker, an alumna of University of Southern California. Mr. &. Mrs. Loker supported the Student Union passionately. After a three-year construction period, the Donald P. & Katherine B Loker University Student Union, Inc. opened its doors. The two-story building upon completion was approx. 67,000 sq. ft. Louis Anderson served as the first LSU Director. Twelve years later, in 2004, a facility renovation was moved up due to a fire in the University Bookstore. It was determined by the Board of Directors that the organization would take the opportunity at hand to facilitate an expansion project. The expansion provided extensive renovations to the original space, which includes the lower level floor. The south end of the main floor that houses the bookstore was also slated to grow in size. Moreover, the project included the addition of entire third floor convention-style ballroom and meeting rooms and a larger main second floor food court that today includes Johnny’s Pizza, Toro Takeout, Taco Bell/A&W, Union Grind, Subway, Panda Express, DH Sports Lounge and Club 1910 restaurant. Finally, a multi-level courtyard was planned to simultaneously separate and connect the two buildings. This outdoor common area would be a place for students and faculty to interact, enjoy plentiful daylight and have a visual connection to the campus around them. Overall, the project nearly doubled the building’s size to 121,042 sq. ft. $4 million of the LSU’s $34.3 million expansion cost was contributed by Katherine B. Loker. In 2007, the building re-opened its doors. The façade to the union, prominently seen from Victoria Street, has become a university landmark and is an identifiable icon on the campus of CSU Dominguez Hills. CSU Dominguez Hills and architects Cannon Design were recognized in 2011 with an Association of College Unions International (ACUI), Facility Design Award, honored for not only the building’s physical appearance, but also how the design concept was developed and how the improvements affected the campus. Today, the LSU houses the University Bookstore, Campus Dining, and Associated Students, Inc., the Office of Student Life and Department of Multicultural Affairs. Most recently, four affinity centers have also been established in the building amid a plethora of services and programs. More than a building, the Loker Student Union is the center and soul of campus life. From design to function, the facility includes a variety of spaces to create a sense of community, expand the avenues through which the university educates students and enhance the quality of daily life for the students/alumni, faculty, staff and guests.

Through its many activities and services, the Loker Student Union provides cultural, social and recreational programming that supports the educational mission of the University, encouraging the development of citizenship, leadership, and social responsibility for success in a dynamic and pluralistic society. Our Logo The LSU went through a year long rebranding process\nthat resulted in a new logo for the organization, a\nrefreshed look inside the student union and renewed\nenergy to take the LSU to the next level. After following a\nstep-by-step process, the analysis and findings led to a\nlogo contest amongst students. The winner of the\ncontest, Adrian Gonzalez, Graphic Designer for the LSU,\ndesigned a creative logo that expresses what the campus\ncommunity felt about the student union. The LSU wanted to provide a consistent experience and\nstrengthen our brand. The logo design relates to the\nletter “X” because this letter is a mark, an indicator and an\nidentifier. The letter “X” marks the spot on maps of a\nspecific location, often the place to be, which makes\nsense given the LSU is both the literal and physical heart\nof the campus. The design is made up of four geometric shapes meeting\nin the center to create unity. Each shape represents a\ndifferent entity found in the LSU: student, staff, faculty\nand administrators. The logo was designed to have a\nsense of movement related to the people who\nconsistently enter and exit the busy building. Core Values Organizational Values matter. We believe that our values assist employees in achieving our mission as well as expressing our core beliefs.

Loker University Student Union, or (LSU) for short, needs to present a consistent identity to ensure instant recognition \nof our brand among a wide variety of audiences around the world. Our identity is important. It affects how people think and feel about the LSU. Our identity is largely shaped by what we do - our activities, our services, and our representation. Our communications play an important role in defining who we are. Our communications are essential in helping the campus community understand what we offer and how we can support students in making the most of their LSU experience.  All LSU employees and volunteers who undertake communication and promotional activity for LSU are responsible for the way in which our brand is implemented. By applying these Loker Student Union brand guidelines, we can all make \nour communications clear, consistent \nand professional. We will be able to convey and promote the academic excellence and cultural significance \nof the Loker Student Union. Color Palette The Loker Student Union brand color palette uses the university’s recognized school colors and integrates them into the design of print and digital materials. Using the CSUDH color palettes helps to create a consistent, distinctive look and feel. The palette is also developed to complement the CSU systemwide brand program. While there is some flexibility to mix these colors, the palette should remain light, clean and contemporary with lots of white space. To ensure the consistency of the organization’s visual identity, Pantone Matching System (Pantone or PMS) specifications for each color are provided. Use the CMYK, RGB or HEX values equivalent to the PMS colors for four-color printing applications and digital applications. Primary Palette BURGUNDY Pantone 209 C PRINT P 66-16 C C=0 M=100 Y=41 K=58 SCREEN HEX #860038 R=134 G=0 B=56 BLACK PRINT C=0 M=100 Y=0 K=100 SCREEN HEX #000000 R=0 G=0 B=0 WHITE PRINT C=0 M=100 Y=0 K=0 SCREEN HEX #FFFFFF R=225 G=225 B=225 Secondary Palette YELLOW Pantone 124 C PRINT P 10-8 C C=0 M=27 Y=100 K=0 SCREEN HEX #EFBA08 R=239 G=186 B=8 GREY Pantone Cool Grey 9 C or black at 75% PRINT Pantone Cool Grey 9 PC C=56 M=46 Y=44 K=10 SCREEN HEX #75787B R=117 G=120 B=123 RICH BLACK PRINT For large areas of coverage C=90 M=80 Y=80 K=100 Cool Grey Color Range or % of Black Logo Versions The logo and word mark are the cornerstones of all communication efforts and must be applied consistently to convey a unified identity for the\norganization. The LSU does not allow new or alternative logos or word marks to be used within the LSU, including logos for departments, units and programs. This is to avoid the creation of sub brands and identities competing with the LSU logo and compromising its integrity. The LSU logo is an unregistered trademark and the LSU reserves all rights to its use. This means it can be used by any of our staff, we just ask you to use it correctly. The logo is always required on every LSU publication (prints or digital) or piece of publicity unless already provided in the footer. We can achieve this goal through correct usage of the logo and word mark as outlined in the following pages of the brand guide. The brand guide contains guidelines for the proper use of the logo and word mark; the Manager of Marketing, Programs and Assessment must approve any exceptions. Use With 3rd Party Logos If LSU is the primary provider of an activity or event, the logo must be in a larger size than the other parties’ logos. If the LSU is a co-sponsor or collaborator, the logo can be the same size as others’ logos. File Formats The logo must always be reproduced from a digital master reference. - pdf - jpeg - png Word Mark Logo Horizontal Logo Logo Versions The symbolic significance of the logo and word mark must be safeguarded so that we communicate an unified identity for the organization. We can achieve this goal through correct usage of the logo and word mark as outlined in the following pages of the brand guide. The brand guide contains guidelines for the proper use of the logo and word mark; the Manager of Marketing, Programs and Assessment must approve any exceptions. Under no circumstance can the logo be redrawn or modified. The logo must always be used with the word mark. The logo can not stand alone on selected promotional materials; however, the\nword mark can be used alone. The logo will be used in the colors (depending on background color) shown below. The logo must have an\nappropriate quiet zone around it (half inch). This is a space in which other text or logos must not impede. Logo Misuse - Horizontal Logo Misuse Accessibility The logo must always have good contrast with the background to ensure maximum impact and accessibility. Spacing & Size In order to maximize its visual presence the logo requires a surrounding area clear of any other graphic elements or text. Always allow at least this amount of clear space around the logo. It is important that this rule is observed and the exclusion zone is maintained at all times. The recommended minimum clearance is to protect the logo. The logo will appear on many different applications and formats and this will help to give it clarity and presence. This is not a placement guide. It is a minimum only. Logo size consistency is important\nwhen producing a wide range of communications. Placement The logo always appears in a set size and position on all our communications. Minimum Size Our logo must be clearly visible and reproduced consistently. For this reason, a minimum size has been established. Minimum Clear Space Minimum Clear Space Around the logo: Print 0.35 inches Online 25.2 pixels Minimum Clear Space Around the logo: Print 0.35 inches Online 25.2 pixels Minimum Size Minimum Width Size: Print 1 inch Online 72 pixels Minimum Width Size: Print 2.5 inches Online 180 pixels Branded Typefaces The typefaces used in the Loker Student Union communications are also brand and graphic identifiers and require the same consistency as the logos. Approved typefaces for the Loker Student Union logo and descriptors must not be altered. The typefaces families, Avenir, Avenir Next, Avenir Next Condensed and Arial, have been selected for use on Loker Student Union print communications. The typefaces allow flexibility while maintaining a consistent visual character within the whole range of communication materials.

Loker Student Union (LSU) at California State University, Dominguez Hills, was created to serve students and the larger community of CSUDH, with the intent of providing co-curricular education, an environment in which students can develop and call their own. After a student referendum was passed, The California State University began collecting fees for a Student Union building in 1985. This action in conjunction with a campus fundraising campaign entitled FutureNow garnered substantial support for the student union project. In 1989, a ground-breaking ceremony was held and construction of the union facility commenced. Present at the groundbreaking and throughout the life of the project were Donald P. & Katherine B. Loker. Donald Loker, an alumnus of Harvard and Katherine Loker, an alumna of University of Southern California. Mr. &. Mrs. Loker supported the Student Union passionately. After a three-year construction period, the Donald P. & Katherine B Loker University Student Union, Inc. opened its doors. The two-story building upon completion was approx. 67,000 sq. ft. Louis Anderson served as the first LSU Director. Twelve years later, in 2004, a facility renovation was moved up due to a fire in the University Bookstore. It was determined by the Board of Directors that the organization would take the opportunity at hand to facilitate an expansion project. The expansion provided extensive renovations to the original space, which includes the lower level floor. The south end of the main floor that houses the bookstore was also slated to grow in size. Moreover, the project included the addition of entire third floor convention-style ballroom and meeting rooms and a larger main second floor food court that today includes Johnny’s Pizza, Toro Takeout, Taco Bell/A&W, Union Grind, Subway, Panda Express, DH Sports Lounge and Club 1910 restaurant. Finally, a multi-level courtyard was planned to simultaneously separate and connect the two buildings. This outdoor common area would be a place for students and faculty to interact, enjoy plentiful daylight and have a visual connection to the campus around them. Overall, the project nearly doubled the building’s size to 121,042 sq. ft. $4 million of the LSU’s $34.3 million expansion cost was contributed by Katherine B. Loker. In 2007, the building re-opened its doors. The façade to the union, prominently seen from Victoria Street, has become a university landmark and is an identifiable icon on the campus of CSU Dominguez Hills. CSU Dominguez Hills and architects Cannon Design were recognized in 2011 with an Association of College Unions International (ACUI), Facility Design Award, honored for not only the building’s physical appearance, but also how the design concept was developed and how the improvements affected the campus. Today, the LSU houses the University Bookstore, Campus Dining, and Associated Students, Inc., the Office of Student Life and Department of Multicultural Affairs. Most recently, four affinity centers have also been established in the building amid a plethora of services and programs. More than a building, the Loker Student Union is the center and soul of campus life. From design to function, the facility includes a variety of spaces to create a sense of community, expand the avenues through which the university educates students and enhance the quality of daily life for the students/alumni, faculty, staff and guests.

These same students will also travel to meet with State Senators to inform them of hardships you may be enduring and how these can be fixed. Hosted by the Elections Commission of ASI during the spring semester, all students are invited to apply to have their name on the ballot. WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE It’s important for all students to vote for who they believe will best serve them as the official student voice. These future Board of Directors will advocate on your behalf and assist in improving campus culture. It is your duty and your responsibility to vote for those who you believe can accomplish this goal to the fullest. In addition, all students who vote will automatically be entered to win various prizes dependent on how many students actually vote. The more students who vote in the Elections, the more prizes that are unlocked for you to potentially win! 2023 ELECTIONS Dear CSUDH Students, Thank you for participating in election 2023.

The goal of this event is to learn how to properly conduct yourself in a dining environment. Which fork do you grab when the salad is served? Do you grab the left or the right water cup when you’re thirsty? If you’re at dinner on your boss’ dime, what foods don’t make you look less professional? These questions become rudementary after attending a Business Etiquette course. All Business Etiquette events require a $10 refundable deposit in order to reserve your spot at the event. Sign-ups will take place in the ASI office when advertised. MOCKTAILS AND MANAGERS Mocktails and Managers is a formal cocktail setting designed to improve your networking skills. Learn how to properly grab a tasty ordeurve while holding your beverage and engaging with employers. Don’t worry if you drop that cocktail weenie though, the point is to experience and learn from this course without any real world consequences. The Career Center will bring real employers to the event to help coach and encourage proper engagement behavior, so it may be worthwhile to bring an extra resume and some business cards with you. DINING LIKE A BOSS Dining like a Boss is a crash course in how to properly engage with employers during a formal sit-down dinner. It can be confusing with three sets of silverware and as many plates sitting in front of you. Thankfully, ASI and the Career Center are here to help yet again. This course will also recommend what to order and how to avoid making a mess while your boss is talking about your performance. The Career Center will also be able to answer any burning questions you have to ensure you are fully prepared for these settings moving forward.

The vote was unanimous, as the students wanted a large scale concert featuring their favorite performers to cap off the academic year. Based on this feedback, ASI hosted the first Spring Fling event in April 2017 at the StubHub Center (now called Dignity Health Sports Park), featuring live student DJs and performers, interactive vendors, obstacle courses and other games and giveaways. Nearly 1,000 students were in attendance and the reception was mostly positive. Students enjoyed the atmosphere and enjoyed themselves, but the biggest concern we received was that students were interested in attending this event again on the premise that ASI could secure a popular artist. Taking pride in student feedback and suggestions, another survey was sent out in 2018 asking who the campus would like to see perform if ASI were able to secure a popular artists. Some of the names included Ty Dolla Sign, Dom Kennedy, Schoolboy Q, 2 Chainz and more. The students voted and ASI responded; 2 Chainz performed in front of 2,000+ students and their guests at the StubHub Center and from here, a tradition was born. Along with student DJs serving as the opening act, the student reception was well received and were already looking forward to how Spring Fling would improve moving forward. Spring Fling is a concert taking place at the end of the academic year, completely dedicated to the students and their requests. Featuring live performances, giveaways and more, Spring Fling is the big event that students look forward to every year. Generally taking place at the Dignity Health Sports Park Pitch and Pale area, the event is aimed towards students but guests are invited. This page will serve as an informational hub for the event and provide important details and updates about Spring Fling.

From tabling efforts to registering students to vote, our goal is to ensure students are aware of the importance of their vote. Below is a compilation of previous campaigns and events produced by ASI. 2020 CAMPAIGN – MAKE YOUR MARK During the 2018 Elections, nearly forty percent of college students who were eligible to vote cast their ballots and made their mark. With a Presidential Election looming in 2020, the Associated Students, Inc. and the Loker Student Union are looking to do their part and increase that number. The Make Your Mark campaign promotes students to safely register to vote by sharing testimonials from their student government leaders. The campaign will also encourage students to apply for mail-in ballots and provide basic information on the propositions that will appear on the November ballot. The Associated Students, Inc. will host several events and continue to publish new content to assist students with the Voter Registration process. This page collects this information to showcases the events, marketing efforts and platforms used to help students understand the gravity of their vote. 632 Students we helped register to vote in 2020 VOTER REGISTRATION TABLING Voter Registration Tabling helps students understand what will be on their ballots and the meaning of casting their vote. We educated students on various ballot measures and the effect a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote brings as well as the top platforms for Presidential candidates to help make an informed decision. This event is generally hosted on National Voter Registration Day. ASI has partnered with the League of Women Voters, United Parents and Students non-profit, and When We All Vote. ASI partnered with the History Department, Africana Studies, and Lambda Rho Sigma Chapter to help students get to the polls by offering free shuttle rides to and from their local polling places. LEGISLATIVE MIX AND MATCH To help students understand the local and state measures being voted on each year, the Legislative Mix and Match educates students by talking to their ASI Board Members and learning about what to expect on the upcoming ballot. Students will also learn how state measures and bonds could potentially effect their college education and the work force upon leaving CSU Dominguez Hills.

A spacious yard with various activities provide these children with exercise and time with their friends. Enroll Today Located on Campus We understand the difficulties and the stress of leaving your child at a distant location, which is why the Children's Center is ideal for student parents, staff and faculty of CSU Dominguez Hills. Campus Map Our Philosophy We believe in providing an environment that meets the developmental needs of the individual child. We also believe understanding how children’s abilities progress and support them with enriched academic program that show the typical developmental skills for your child to be ready for Kindergarten. The learning environment includes a balance of teacher-guided and child-initiated experiences in art, music and movement, dramatic play, language development, reading and writing readiness, motor development, mathematics, science, and multi-cultural awareness.  We encourage and support active, hands-on learning through exploration, manipulation, and critical thinking. We believe children are to be respected and treated with courtesy, dignity, patience and compassion.  It is through the child’s relationship with the environment, materials, and others that they learn respect, self-regulation, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and compassion.  Believing that parents are a child’s first and most important teacher, we work to support and partner with families in their child’s development. ​ Read our Mission Statement 67 Families Serviced 83 Children Served 6000 Days of attendance in total by all children Tuition Rates Below reflects current student rates.

Our identity is important. It affects how people think and feel about ASI. Our identity is largely shaped by what we do – our activities, our services, and our representation. Our communications play an important role in defining who we are. Our communications are essential in helping the campus community understand what we offer and how we can support students in making the most of their ASI experience. All ASI professional staff members and student staff who undertake communication and promotional activity for ASI are responsible for the way in which our brand is implemented. By applying these Associated Students, Inc. brand guidelines, we can all make our communications clear, consistent and professional. We will be able to convey and promote the academic excellence and cultural significance of the ASI. COLOR PALETTE The Associated Students, Inc. brand color palette uses the University’s recognized school colors and integrates them into the design of print and digital materials. Using the CSUDH color palettes helps to create a consistent, distinctive look and feel. The palette is also developed to complement the CSU systemwide brand program. While there is some flexibility to mix these colors, the palette should remain light, clean and contemporary with lots of white space. To ensure the consistency of the organization’s visual identity, Pantone Matching System (Pantone or PMS) specifications for each color are provided. Use the CMYK, RGB or HEX values equivalent to the PMS colors for four-color printing applications and digital applications. Burgundy Yellow Black White LOGO USAGE The logo and word mark are the cornerstones of all communication efforts and must be applied consistently to convey a unified identity for the organization. The ASI does not allow new or alternative logos or word marks to be used within the ASI, including logos for departments, units and programs. This is to avoid the creation of sub brands and identities competing with the LSU logo and compromising its integrity. The ASI logo is a registered trademark and the ASI reserves all rights to its use. The logo is always required on every ASI publication (prints or digital) or piece of publicity unless already provided in the footer. We can achieve this goal through correct usage of the logo and word mark as outlined in the following pages of the brand guide. The brand guide contains guidelines for the proper use of the logo and word mark; the Program Coordinator must approve any exceptions. The below ASI logo varaints are pre-approved for use. Right click and select ‘Save Image As’ to use the ASI logo of your preference. All images are 1000×1000 JPEG files. In order to maximize its visual presence the logo requires a surrounding area clear of any other graphic elements or text. Always allow at least this amount of clear space around the logo. It is important that this rule is observed and the exclusion zone is maintained at all times. The recommended minimum clearance is to protect the logo. The logo will appear on many different applications and formats and this will help to give it clarity and presence. This is not a placement guide. It is a minimum only. Logo size consistency is important when producing a wide range of communications. Our logo must be clearly visible and reproduced consistently. For this reason, a minimum size has been established.

Events hosted by the Associated Students, Inc. that are cancelled due to this news will be listed here and on our social media . To: Campus Community From: President Parham Dear campus community, Yesterday, Chancellor Timothy White announced [PDF] that the California State University system will continue to operate in a primarily virtual environment through the spring 2021 semester. It was a difficult decision, but very appropriate, and one that I wholeheartedly support. I am writing today to confirm that CSUDH will follow suit and remain primarily virtual this spring. The CSU system was among the first in the nation to announce that the fall 2020 semester would be primarily virtual. Once again, a far-sighted approach is being taken, with the principal goal of protecting the health and safety of every member of our campus community, while we continue our best efforts to ensure student success. Making this decision early on also will allow everyone at CSUDH – faculty, staff, students, and senior executives – to adequately prepare for this eventuality, and align our efforts with those outcomes. This is not a decision that has been taken lightly. Every member of Toro Nation is eager to get back on campus, as am I, but this is not a situation in which we can just “flip a switch” and make everything return to normal. With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging throughout the nation, the local incidence and prevalence data of those infected with the virus being unacceptably high, and our demographic population that statistics show are more vulnerable to the disease and its consequential effects, there is simply no way to ensure that a spring return to campus would be feasible. We have seen examples of universities across the U.S. that have returned to campus too early, with tragic and predictable results. Even those whose principally virtual return has allowed higher numbers of in-person courses and returnees are themselves being challenged with the consequences of a less than predictable situation. Chancellor White’s leadership during the crisis has kept the CSU community safe and healthy, and yesterday’s announcement is another example of his wise and necessarily cautious approach. I commend him and my CSU President colleagues on their willingness to “lean in” and make the tough decisions that are needed during such a momentous time. Rest assured, your administration and executive leadership will work with every stakeholder to create a workable plan for moving forward this spring. In the end, all decisions will be driven by the bottom line of protecting the health and safety of Toro Nation, while doing our best to support faculty and staff, and facilitate the success of our students. This has been a trying time for all of us, and yesterday’s news was further confirmation that we have challenging days ahead. Still, I remain confident that our students, faculty, staff, and senior executives will continue to rise to the challenge, striving for excellence even in the face of daunting adversity. More information about the spring semester will be released in the weeks ahead. For the most recent news and updates about the COVID-19 pandemic, please visit csudh.edu/together . Thank you for your patience and understanding. Stay strong, Toros, and please comply with all health and safety protocols. We will get through this, because that is what we do in the Toro Nation! Thomas A. Parham, Ph.D. President For more information on the COVID-19 virus and how the CSU system is taking measures to protect its students, please refer to the CSU Website .

Club points are earned by attending or hosting the events listed below. To receive points for attending or hosting events, organizations must submit a Club Points Sheet to the Organization Commissioner no later than one week after the event. At the last Organizations Commission meeting of the academic year, first, second, and third place awards will be given to the organization that holds the most club points. Purpose The purpose of the policy is to provide overall guidance to the Organizations Commission club point system to ensure the system does not change from year to year in its overall content but remains consistent in order to provide fairness to those clubs and organizations who participate with ASI through the ASI Organizations Commission. Policy Only members of recognized clubs and organizations are eligible to receive club points. Club points will be given to each club or organization who attend events by a sign-in sheet or other items of proof. The University President or their designee will check with the Office of Student Life (OSL) for verification of registration of the organization or its members if necessary. Each organization sponsoring an event must ensure that the event increases awareness on campus such as philanthropy, guest speakers, and cultural awareness. When a student organization and/or Greek organization is sponsoring an event, they must register their event on Toro Link. The sponsoring organization shall email the Chair of the Clubs and Organizations Commissions a link to their event registration. The CLUB POINT sheet must be submitted via Toro Link or Social Media, no later than a week after the event. Failure to turn in club points sheet at the required time will forfeit the club/org from earning points for that event. Members are only allowed to represent up to two clubs at any given event (i.e. if you are a member of the TV club, Film club, and Theater club, you will only be able to represent two of those organizations). In the event, a member signs-in for more than two organizations will result in that member receiving no points for none of the clubs. Student Organizations and Greeks sponsoring an Organization Showcase will be eligible for club points only when ALL organizations are given an opportunity to attend the sponsored showcase. Examples: events such as Toro Days, Unity Fest, Welcome Week. Each hosting organization is required to assign one executive officer to submit club points. Awards and Accolades The Chair of the Clubs and Organizations Committee will submit a count of all club points to the commission two times a semester. At the last Clubs and Organization Commission meeting, the top three clubs and/or organizations will be recognized for their outstanding contribution for the school year. Violations 1. Representing more than two clubs and organizations at any events listed in the club point’s chart within the policy. 2. Members of a club or organization that sponsors or co-sponsors an event will not be able to receive volunteer and/or attendance points as well. 3. Members of clubs or organizations that volunteer or are employed at/for campus events will not be eligible to receive attendance points as well. 4. Clubs and organizations that do not submit the club points within one week will not be eligible to receive any points for the said event. 5. If points are submitted by a non-executive officer points will be considered invalid.

Associated Students, Inc. (ASI) at California State University, Dominguez Hills, utilizes social media to promote events and programs hosted and/or sponsored by ASI. In addition, social media serves as a tool to increase student involvement on campus, to inform student concerns, direct users to informational websites, and create a helpful and welcoming Internet environment. Social media is a powerful tool to exchange information, raise the visibility of the university and engage with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the Carson community. While social media is an effective communication tool, it also brings its own unique challenges. Individuals who contribute to official Associated Students, Inc.-affiliated social media accounts in their capacity as representatives of California State University, Dominguez Hills as a part of their employment must be mindful to post as a voice of ASI, not their personal views. This social media Policy serves to protect Associated Students, Inc.’s legal interests and reputation, including its students, faculty, and staff through the responsible and reliable usage of all social media outlets belonging to ASI Marketing, Programming, and Public Relations personnel. Social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tik Tok and the ASI website allow Associated Students Inc. to accomplish their mission statement and goals regarding students’ representation at CSU Dominguez Hills.

All social media pages related to ASI at California State Dominguez Hills should include accurate contact information, including email addresses and phone numbers. Additionally, the social media pages should include the correct link that directs back to ASI’s web properties. All social media log in information, such as usernames, emails, and passwords, are to remain confidential to everyone except for the Program Assistant for Social Media, Marketing and Public Relations Coordinator and Executive Director. In addition, all private messages and student interactions with Associated Students, Inc. on the Internet are classified and confidential. This serves to protect both ASI and student’s privacy, while maintaining a positive public environment for all viewers. If any information is shared and compromised, the Program Assistant for Social Media or the Marketing and Public Relations Coordinator shall be notified to resolve the situation immediately. The content of ASI social media sites shall pertain to ASI-sponsored or ASI-endorsed initiatives, programs, services, and events. Content includes, but is not limited to photographs, videos, and hyperlinks. All social media content shall have the appropriate and correct information, references, and links. All requests for a post outside of the ASI organization must be made to the Marketing and Public Relations Coordinator. Programming and events financially sponsored by ASI do not require a request.

Any posts, comments, or accounts on Associated Students, Inc. social media platforms are authorized to be edited or deleted at the discretion of the Program Assistant for Social Media.

TORO TUESDAYS will serve as the official day to wear California State University, Dominguez Hills Gear. Dominguez Hills Gear consists of: University distinguished colored Burgundy and Gold paraphernalia with the CSU, Dominguez Hills name Any other colored paraphernalia with the CSU Dominguez Hills name Any number of similar items being worn will count for one raffle ticket. For instance, three different key chains will merit one raffle ticket Items with the original intent to wear will be counted, not items intended for other use such as pens and pencils Inappropriate placement of items or inappropriate exposure will result in disqualification and not being able to participate in ASI programs for the duration of the school year. To promote the Toro Tuesday resolution, ASI initiated the Toro Tuesday weekly drawing and the Toro Tuesday Grand Finale. Students can enter the weekly drawing every Tuesday by wearing school paraphernalia and signing in the Toro Tuesday sheet at the ASI office.  The winner of the weekly drawing will receive ASI promotional items and be entered in the Toro Tuesday Grand Finale drawing at the end of the semester.  The winner of the Toro Tuesday Grand Finale will receive a scholarship* in the following semester from ASI. Student must have an active account with the University in order to receive the scholarship. Students who do not have a student account with the University will be ineligible to receive the scholarship. Students should first consult with Financial Aid before participating. Monetary amount will be determined by the ASI Finance Commission during prior year budget cycle. TORO TUESDAY WEEKLY DRAWING Sign-Up: Toro Tuesday begins during the second week of each semester. On the scheduled Tuesdays of the fall and spring semester, a sign-up sheet is placed at the front desk of the ASI office for students to enter the weekly Toro Tuesday raffle drawing. Students are asked to present a valid student identification card prior to signing-up.  Each student is required to enter their first name, last name, signature, student identification number, club or org (optional), phone number and e-mail.  Based on the number of items worn, the corresponding number of raffle ticket(s) will be entered into the raffle basket. Drawing: Within the same week, a raffle ticket will be drawn by a random student (not an ASI representative) to pull out the winning ticket. The selected ticket is then matched with the corresponding student from the sign-in sheet who will be the weekly winner. Winner’s Notification: Winners are notified via e-mail and/or a phone call that they are the Toro Tuesday winner for the week. Winners are asked to come by the ASI office to pick up their prize. Weekly Prize: Winners are asked to complete the winner’s form and present their student identification card for confirmation upon winning. Once the winner’s form is completed, winners are given their weekly prize. VIRTUAL TORO TUESDAY If students are unable to access campus (global pandemic, campus shutdown, etc.), Toro Tuesday will be conducted on the ASI social media channels. Participation: Every Tuesday, the ASI social media accounts will ask students to participate in a “Theme of the Week” post. Students will be asked to participate in the “Theme of the Week” and tag the appropriate ASI social media account to receive an entry. An additional entry will be rewarded to the student if they are wearing any amount of campus attire. For example, if a student takes a photo of themselves and is wearing multiple Dominguez Hills attire, they will receive two entries for that week. Students will be allowed to post a second time to increase their entries for the week. The maximum entries per student per week shall be four. Drawing : Within the same week, all student participants will have their name entered into an Excel or Google Sheets page with a number assigned to their name. A random number generator will be used to select the winner of the weekly drawing, with the winning number being matched to the corresponding student from the participation sheet. Winner’s Notification: Winners are notified via e-mail and/or a phone call that they are the Toro Tuesday winner for the week. Weekly Prize: Winners are asked to complete and submit the winner’s form. Once the winner’s form is completed, winners will be emailed a virtual gift card as their weekly prize. All prizes must be claimed prior to the end of the semester for which they were issued. TORO TUESDAY GRAND FINALE DRAWING Drawing Logistics: All weekly winners’ names are printed in a legal-size paper, pre-folded and placed in the basket prior to the event.  Winners are notified via e-mail about the date, time, and location of the drawing.  There are normally fourteen weekly winners and the Grand Finale is drawn the 15th week of the semester or the week prior to finals week. Grand Drawing Winner Selection: A raffle basket with the pre-folded names will be brought out at the start of the event. An ASI representative will pull one piece of paper out of the basket at a time. The last two remaining names pulled out will be the Toro Tuesday Grand Prize winners. *If the final two names drawn are the same student, the $2,000 scholarship will be deferred to the previously removed student entry. Virtual Grand Finale Logistics : If students are unable to access campus (global pandemic, campus shutdown, etc.), the Toro Tuesday Grand Finale will be conducted on the ASI social media channels. A raffle basket with the pre-folded names will be brought out at the start of the event. An ASI representative will pull one piece of paper out of the basket at a time. The last two remaining names pulled out will be the Toro Tuesday Grand Prize winners. *If the final two names drawn are the same student, the $2,000 scholarship will be deferred to the previously removed student entry. The scholarship will be processed through Financial Aid Office, to be credited directly into the student’s account for the following semester. STUDENT REQUIREMENTS Student must be taking a minimum of twelve (12) units during the fall or spring semester, except for a student who is registered with the Student disAbility Resource Center (SdRC). If any classes are dropped before the Add/Drop week, the student will be ineligible to receive the scholarship. Seniors that are graduating during the current semester will be ineligible unless they are re-enrolling for another program within the University or have loans/debt that is affiliated with California State University, Dominguez Hills. To receive the scholarship, a student must have an active student account in the following semester with Financial Aid in order to successfully process the scholarship. Please note that any further issues that should arise (that are not within the Toro Tuesday Guidelines) will vary from a student-to-student basis. *Amendment is pending approval YOUR STUDENT GOVERNMENT 1000 East Victoria Street Carson, CA 90747 Loker Student Union Room 231 Email: asi@csudh.edu Phone: 310-243-3686 Fax: 310-928-7141 OFFICE HOURS Monday: 9am to 5pm Tuesday: 9am to 5pm Wednesday: 9am to 5pm Thursday: 9am to 5pm Friday: 9am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday: Closed FOLLOW US @ASICSUDH SPEAK UP!

The Student Activity Fee (ASI Fee) falls into the category of mandatory campus fees that are deemed non-refundable as they generally cover fixed and ongoing expenses that the university and auxiliary entities continue to incur during the pandemic to maintain instruction, and operate student programs, services and facilities, many of which remain available to students virtually. You can find the CSU policy here: https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/7826195/latest/ If you have additional questions about the policy, please email csu-chancellor@calstate.edu Will I be charged any fees while the Children's Center is closed? Effective March 16, 2020, the ASI Children’s Center suspended the collection of family fees and issued pro-rated refund to private pay families for the remainder of March 2020. Distance learning services were offered to all families from March through August 2020. Effective August 28, 2020, the center closed and suspended all services. Should the center reopen and resume services earlier than anticipated, fees will be waived for all subsidized families receiving distance learning services. The ASI Children’s Center will not be collecting any tuition from families during the closure. What is a mandatory fee? Mandatory student fees pay for programs, services, and spaces that students decided they wanted and imposed fees on themselves and future students at CSUDH. Traditionally mandatory fees are initiated and adjusted by students through a student referendum . Similar to community-based taxes, all current students vote in a student referendum to self-impose mandatory fees so they can have campus amenities and services e.g., student activity fee for government, services and advocacy, student union, and other services and programs designed and based on students’ needs during their time at CSU Dominguez Hills. Mandatory fees can also be initiated by Presidential Alternative Consultation , which is a process used when the university president determines a fee referendum is not the best mechanism for appropriate and meaningful consultation with students. For example, in 2014, the Student Success Fee was authorized by Chancellor White following an alternative consultation process initiated by then university president Willie J. Hagan. Additionally in 2018, the ASI fee distribution was adjusted via presidential alternative consultation to better fulfill the needs of the student population. What purpose do mandatory fees serve? CSUDH has six mandatory student fees: the student activity fee (ASI), the student union fee, the Health Facilities fee, the Health Services fee, the Instructionally Related Activities (IRA) fee, and the Student Success fee. The student activity fee is managed by Associated Students, Inc., a non-profit corporation governed by a student board and administered by professional staff and part-time student employees. The ASI mandatory fees cover the cost of student representation and governance, funding for student clubs and organizations, student services and programs, and the ASI Children’s Center. Additionally, ASI supports various campus programs, departments and student initiatives including Intercollegiate Athletics, the Toro Learning and Testing Center, the Multicultural Affairs, and Affinity Centers (Rose Black Resource, Queer Culture Resource, and Toro Dreamers Success Centers). Why do students have to pay a mandatory fee during this virtual learning environment? During the COVlD-19 crisis, ASI has maintained its student representation and governance, student clubs/organizations activities and accounting services, and ASI programs and services have been moved online. These activities continuously require funds and costs to be run and operated even in a virtual environment. Student leaders and employees are working remotely, and student programs and services are available online through virtual platforms accessible to students while learning off campus. Additionally, ASI’s financial support to the following departments Intercollegiate Athletics, the Toro Learning and Testing Center, the Multicultural Affairs, and Affinity Centers (Rose Black Resource, Queer Culture Resource, and Toro Dreamers Success Centers) provides funds for students’ scholarships, employment, and programming dollars to support the academic and co-curricular development of all CSUDH students.  ASI provides $29 per student to Intercollegiate Athletics, $4 per student to the Toro Learning and Testing Center, and $100,000 to the Multicultural Affairs and Affinity Centers. STUDENT FEE DISTRIBUTION Associated Students Inc Intercollegiate Athletics Multicultural Affairs Toro Learning Center Each student pays approximately $135 for an ASI Fee. This is taken out of their normal tuition payment and is not an additional payment that needs to be made. This fee is non-optional and is part of what students pay per semester to help fund services provided by the Associated Students, Inc. ASI is your student government corporation, which represents the students’ interests and voice on campus, locally and statewide. This page includes a breakdown of where those dollars are spent within the Associated Students, Inc., and how we use that money to give back to the students.
