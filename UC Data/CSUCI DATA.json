Surfing has increased in cultural, social, and economic importance through the last century and is now globally significant. Predicated on the natural phenomenon of ocean waves interacting with coasts, surfing’s future is threatened by Earth’s changing climate. This paper provides a comprehensive review of physical processes, including swell generation, wave breaking, and coastal dynamics, relevant for the locations — surf breaks — where surfing occurs and the myriad mechanisms through which each can be affected by a changing climate. We propose an organizing framework for these impacts characterizing them based on their mode of action as direct versus indirect, as well as by their magnitude, and conclude that some impacts (such as sea level rise) may threaten some breaks but on more protracted timelines, whereas other impacts (such as coastal armoring implemented in response to climate change) may pose more immediate, existential threats. This framework underscores the importance of local environmental knowledge of a given surf break for understanding its susceptibility to climate change and informs a Surf Break Vulnerability–Climate Change Assessment Tool (SurfCAT), designed to enable improved wave stewardship by local resource managers and stakeholders in the face of a changing climate.

OK Warning Signs of Abuse Know what to look for. warning signs of abuse Recognize the warning signs of abuse At the start of a new relationship, it’s not always easy to tell if it will later become abusive. In fact, many abusive people appear like ideal partners in the early stages of a relationship. The warning signs of abuse don’t always appear overnight and may emerge and intensify as the relationship grows. Every relationship is certainly different, and domestic violence doesn’t always look the same. However, one feature shared by most abusive relationships is that the abusive partner tries to establish or gain power and control through many different methods at different moments. Common signs of abusive behavior in a partner include: Even one or two of these behaviors in a relationship is a red flag that abuse may be present. Telling you that you never do anything right. Showing extreme jealousy of your friends or time spent away from them. Preventing or discouraging you from spending time with others, particularly friends, family members, or peers. Insulting, demeaning, or shaming you, especially in front of other people. Preventing you from making your own decisions, including about working or attending school. Controlling finances in the household without discussion, such as taking your money or refusing to provide money for necessary expenses. Pressuring you to have sex or perform sexual acts you’re not comfortable with. Pressuring you to use drugs or alcohol. Intimidating you through threatening looks or actions. Insulting your parenting or threatening to harm or take away your children or pets. Intimidating you with weapons like guns, knives, bats, or mace. Destroying your belongings or your home. Our advocates are available 24/7 to discuss your situation and identify available options to help ensure your safety. Remember: no one deserves to experience abuse of any kind—for any reason. And every type of abuse is serious.

Unlike other crimes that involve a single incident, stalking is a pattern of behavior. It is often made up of individual acts that could, by themselves, seem harmless or noncriminal, but when taken in the context of a stalking situation, could constitute criminal acts. Legal definitions of stalking differ depending on where you live; however stalking is a crime under the laws of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Territories, and the Federal government. Stalking is serious, often violent, and can escalate over time. What is Stalking? While this list isn’t exhaustive, you may be a victim of stalking if someone: Repeatedly calls your phone, including hang-ups Follows you and shows up wherever you are Sends unwanted gifts, letters, texts, or emails Damages your home, car, or other property Monitors your phone calls or computer use, possibly through spyware Uses technology, like hidden cameras or global positioning systems (GPS), to track where you go Drives by or lingers near your home, school, or work Threatens to hurt you, your family, friends, or pets Performs other actions that control, track, or frighten you Uses other people to try to communicate with you, like children, family, or friends If you have been stalked, you may: Be fearful of what the stalker is capable of doing Feel vulnerable, unsafe, or not know who to trust Feel depressed, hopeless, angry, anxious, irritable, on-edge, and hypervigilant Have flashbacks, disturbing thoughts, feelings, or memories Feel confused, frustrated, or isolated because other people don’t understand why you are afraid Miss work or school for fear of seeing your stalker Change your normal or preferred social media habits What can I do? While there is no universal set of steps that will work for everyone, these actions may help you feel in control of your life again: Call 911 for Immediate Assistance – You know yourself and your situation better than anyone. Trust your instincts and call for help if you feel you are in danger. Alert Others – Tell trusted friends, family, neighbors, coworkers, and/or your HR department to keep an eye out for suspicious activity and so they don’t mistakenly give out information to someone pretending to be a loved one. Connect with an Advocate – Advocates can often be found at local domestic violence and/or sexual assault agencies, police departments, and district attorney’s offices. Advocates can help explain local stalking laws, walk you through filing a protective order, connect you with local services, and help you develop a safety plan. Document Every Incident – Make a log of encounters with the stalker, hang-up calls, and public sightings. Save all messages, emails, and your call history. Consider using this incident and behavior log form from the Stalking Prevention, Awareness, & Resource Center (SPARC). End All Contact – Sometimes this is easier said than done, but try not to answer calls or messages, even if you are requesting that the stalker stop. Any contact may encourage the stalker to continue the stalking behavior. Take Threats Seriously –A direct threat against you is an obvious sign of danger. A stalker can also use threats of suicide or self-harm to manipulate you into staying in contact or a dangerous situation. Create a Safety Plan – Develop a personalized plan to keep yourself safe. Find help doing this here or connect with an advocate for assistance. Prepare Your Children – Teach your children what to do if there is an emergency, like where to hide if there is danger in the house, or how to call the police or a trusted person for help.

For a restraining order to be valid, the restrained party must be properly served. There are four different types of restraining orders available to the public: Family, Civil, Elder Abuse / Dependent Adult, and Workplace Violence. FAMILY RESTRAINING ORDERS Family restraining orders cover persons seeking Temporary Restraining Orders against family members or those involved in marriage, dating or shared parentage relationships. A person qualifies for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order if, based upon threats or abuse, there is an immediate and present danger of violence, stalking or abduction by an abuser to the named person or their household members (including children). There are three types of restraining orders.  An Emergency Protective Order (EPO) is issued at the scene of the incident.  Law Enforcement Officers telephone the on-call magistrate, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, who grants the order based on immediate concerns.  An EPO expires in 5 court or 7 calendar days. A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is granted in court by a commissioner or judge.  This is good for a maximum of 25 days.  A Permanent Restraining Order is granted in court by a judge.  It is valid for up to five years. If a restraining order is sought as a result of documented domestic violence, the fees are waived.  Simply bring your report (obtained from the police agency that handled the incident) or report number with you to the courthouse. Residents in the west part of Ventura County can go to the Ventura Courthouse, 804 S Victoria Ave, Room 311 to begin the restraining order process.  For residents in East County, go to the Simi Valley Courthouse, 3855 Alamo St.  However, you may go to either location regardless of where you live. A restraining order prohibits any party from doing the following: Molesting, attacking, striking, threatening, sexually assaulting, battering, harassing, or disturbing the peace of the other parties. Living together. Directly or indirectly contacting each other.  The order may allow contact for child custody exchanges. If the restrained person does not obey the order, call the police.  Pursuant to Penal Code 273.6, a person who intentionally and knowingly violates a restraining order can be fined up to $1,000.00 and imprisoned for up to one year. CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDERS Civil restraining orders deal with civil matters, neighbor disputes, and general harassment issues. Residents in the west part of Ventura County can go to the Ventura Courthouse, 804 S Victoria Ave, Room 400 to begin the restraining order process.  For residents in East County, go to the Simi Valley Courthouse, 3855 Alamo St.  However, you may go to either location regardless of where you live. You will have to go to court on the date the clerk gives you. The restrained person may come to the court hearing.  However, the person does not have the right to speak to you.  If you are in fear of the person, let the bailiff know. You do not need to bring a witness to the hearing, but it helps to have proof of the harassment.  You can bring: A written statement from witnesses made under oath. Witnesses Photographs Medical or police reports Damaged property Threatening letters, emails or telephone messages The court may not let witnesses testify.  So, if possible, have witnesses written statements under oath at the hearing. A restraining order will not force a roommate to move out.  For this to occur, you must complete the eviction process. Your restraining order is valid anywhere in the United States.  If you move out of California, contact your new local police agency so they are aware of the order. If the restrained person does not obey the order, call the police.  Pursuant to Penal Code 166(a)(4), a person could be guilty of a misdemeanor crime.  If convicted, this could result in a fine and up to one year imprisonment in the county jail. ELDER ABUSE / DEPENDENT ADULT RESTRAINING ORDERS Elder Abuse/Dependent Adult restraining orders are for those who are either over 65, or classified as a dependent adult.  As a result of their age or status, they are being physically, financially or emotionally abused. A dependent adult is defined as someone who is between the ages of 18 and 64, who has physical or mental limitations which restrict his or her ability to carry out normal activities or protect his or her rights.  This includes, but is not limited to, persons who have physical or developmental disabilities or whose physical or mental abilities have diminished because of age. The court can order a person to: Not abuse, harass, hit, or threaten you Not contact or go near you, and Not possess a gun Residents in the west part of Ventura County can go to the Ventura Courthouse, 804 S Victoria Ave, Room 311 to begin the restraining order process.  For residents in East County, go to the Simi Valley Courthouse, 3855 Alamo St.  However, you may go to either location regardless of where you live. If the restraining order is being sought as a result of violence or fear, the fees are waived.  The restraining order process is done at no cost to you.  Bring a copy of your police report, or the report number, with you when you come to the courthouse. If you are deaf, contact the clerk at least 5 days before the hearing.  Ask for an interpreter or other accommodation. If granted, an elder abuse restraining order can last up to three years. If the restrained person does not obey the order, call the police.  Pursuant to Penal Code 166(a)(4), a person could be guilty of a misdemeanor crime.  If convicted, this could result in a fine and up to one year imprisonment in the county jail. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS Workplace violence restraining orders cover harassment and violence at the workplace. Only employers may obtain a restraining order against workplace violence.  If you are seeking a restraining order against a co-worker, use the civil harassment restraining order Under California law, an employer is someone who is: Engaged in any business or enterprise in this state that has one or more persons in service under any appointment, contract of hire, or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, irrespective of whether such a person is the owner of the business or is operating on a concessionaire or other basis. (Labor Code 350(a).) A federal, state or local public agency; a city, county, district, or public corporation. (Code Civ. Proc 527.8(d).) This restraining order protects employees for a period of three years, and certain members of the employees families for 15 days.  Public officers, volunteers, and independent contractors all are covered as “employees.” An employer can seek protection under this law if: An employee has suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence from any individual; The unlawful violence or credible threat of violence can reasonably be construed to have been carried out in the workplace; The defendant’s conduct is not allowed as part of a legitimate labor dispute; and The defendant is not engaged in any constitutionally protected activity. Employers in the west part of Ventura County can go to the Ventura Courthouse, 804 S Victoria Ave, Room 311 to begin the restraining order process.  For employers in East County, go to the Simi Valley Courthouse, 3855 Alamo St.  However, you may go to either location regardless of where you live. If the restrained person does not obey the order, call the police.  Pursuant to Penal Code 166(a)(4), a person could be guilty of a misdemeanor crime.  If convicted, this could result in a fine and up to one year imprisonment in the county jail. Typically, court filing fees for restraining orders are $355.00.  However, in instances where violence or stalking has occurred, the fees are waived.  Also, if you cannot afford to pay the fees, they can be waived. The fee for the Sheriff’s Civil Unit to serve your order is $40.00.  Again, these fees are waived if violence, stalking or an inability to pay exists.

What is Domestic Violence? It’s not always easy to tell at the beginning of a relationship if it will become abusive. Domestic violence can happen to anyone of any race, age, sexual orientation, religion or gender. How Can I Help a Friend? Is someone you know in an unhealthy relationship? There are ways to help. It’s important for you to support them no matter what they decide to do, and help them find a way to safety and peace. Are You Experiencing Abuse? Abusive behavior is a pattern of behaviors used by a person to establish power and control over another. Physical, psychological, emotional, financial, and verbal abuse should all be taken very seriously. How Can I Make a Safety Plan? A safety plan is a personalized, practical plan that includes ways to remain safe while in a relationship or after you leave. Safety planning can help you cope with emotions and gives you the tools to tell friends and family about the abuse. Prevention Our Prevention efforts focus on eradicating domestic abuse and sexual assault at its root causes and addressing the societal factors that allow these issues to exist.

If you use developer features of the Services, including but not limited to Twitter for Websites ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites ), Twitter Cards ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards ), Public API ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs ), or Sign in with Twitter ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter ), you agree to our Developer Agreement ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement ) and Developer Policy ( https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy ).

These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number. Your License to Use the Services We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided on Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights.

General We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at twitter.com/tos , will govern our relationship with you.

By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and us. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law). In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us .

We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above. You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number. Your License to Use the Services We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided on Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain our and our licensors' exclusive property.

Limitations of Liability By using the Services you agree that X Corp., its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents representatives, partners and licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence. 6.

By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us .

        "body": "Twitter Privacy Policy Skip to main content Privacy Policy Twitter Privacy Policy Effective: May 18, 2023 Before you scroll, read this Itâs really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use Twitter want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a Tweet, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail. With that in mind, weâve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use Twitter by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how itâs used, and when itâs shared.Â So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this: Â Twitter is a public platform Learn whatâs viewable & searchable We collect some data about you LearnÂ what we collect & how Affiliate services may have their own policies Learn about affiliates We use your data to make Twitter better Learn how we make your info work You can control your experience Learn how to update your settings If you have questions about how we use data, just ask Learn how to contact us Seriously â what happens with my data? Seriously â what happens with my data? What data do you collect about me? You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings. 1. Information We Collect The information we collect when you use Twitter falls into three categories. Expand dropdowns for more information: 1.1 Information you provide us. To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services. Personal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, âTwitter Momentsâ); a username (for example, @TwitterMoments); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and Tweets, and to upload your address book to Twitter to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple Twitter accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.Â Professional Accounts. If you create a professional account , you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.Â Payment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. Preferences. Â When you set your preferences using yourÂ settings , we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences. 1.2 Information we collect when you use Twitter. When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep Twitter more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you. Â Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on Twitter, including: Tweets and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of Twitter) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., TwitterLive or Spaces), including broadcasts youâve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of. Your interactions with other usersâ content, such as retweets, likes, shares, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts youâve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting). How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, and when you use Direct Messages , including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages. If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content. We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you). Purchase and payments. Â To allow you to make a payment or send money using Twitter features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received. Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access Twitter, including: Information about your connection, such as your IP address and browser type. Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level. Your device address book, if youâve chosen to share it with us. Location Information.Â When you use Twitter, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where youâve previously used Twitter by enabling these settings in your account. Inferred Identity. Â We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below: When you sign into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into Twitter (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or Twitter-generated identifiers). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. When you access Twitter and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect. Log Information. Â We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as: IP address; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on Twitter; Twitter-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter. Advertisements. Â When you view or interact with ads we serve on or off Twitter, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with retweets of or replies to an ad).Â Cookies and similar technologies. Â Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here . Interactions with our content on third-party sites. Â When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited. Â 1.3 Information we receive from third parties. When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us. Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers. Â Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, Twitter-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that Twitter receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. Â We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other Twitter users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates , and other services you link to your Twitter account. You may choose to connect your Twitter account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. Â How do you use my information? To make Twitter the service you know and love. 2. How We Use Information Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think itâs most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us . Here we go: Expand dropdowns for more information: Â 2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services. We use the information we collect to provide and operate Twitter products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on Twitter, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates , third-party apps, and services.Â We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect your Twitter account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings , which helps make ads on Twitter more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that Twitter receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy. 2.2  Foster safety and security. We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on Twitter - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law. Â 2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better. We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better. 2.4 Communicate with you about our services. We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If youâre open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time. 2.5 Research. We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services. My Tweets are public?!? My Tweets are public?!? How or when do you share my information? Thereâs no quick answer to this one, but heads up: Tweets can end up in the news or a search engine. 3. Sharing Information You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information. Expand dropdowns for more information: Â 3.1 When you Tweet, post, and share. With the general public .Â You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. Twitter content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view much of the content on Twitter. They may also find Twitter content off of Twitter, for example from search query results on Internet search engines. With other Twitter users. Depending on your settings , and based on the Twitter products and services you use, we share: Your interactions with Twitter content of other users, such as likes, and people you follow. Content you send to a specific Twitter user, such as through Direct Messages . Please keep in mind that if youâve shared information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service. With partners. Â Depending on your settings , we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center . You can control whether Twitter shares your personal information with these partners by using the âData sharing with business partnersâ option in your Privacy & Safety settings . (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.) Â 3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations. With service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; and those that provide fraud detection services.Â With advertisers. Â Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off Twitter. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from Twitter, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other Twitter-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address. Third-party content & integrations. Â We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on Twitter or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically. Through our APIs. Â We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public Twitter information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com . Â 3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest. We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to: comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request ; protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services; explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of Twitter Rules ); address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services. 3.4 With our Affiliates. We may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services. 3.5 As a result of a change in ownership. We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity. Does data have an expiration date? Does data have an expiration date? How long do you keep data? Generally, we keep your data as long as your account is up. 4. How Long We Keep Information We keep different types of information for different periods of time:Â We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account. We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months. Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from Twitter. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your Tweets longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on Twitter. You can read more about search visibility here . Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts. We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. How can I control my data? You can access it, delete it, or change your settings. Basically, youâre the boss. 5. Take Control Expand dropdowns for more information: Â 5.1 Access, Correction, Portability. You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings . You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your Twitter Data and request access to additional information here . You can download a copy of your information, such as your Tweets, by following the instructions here . On the Periscope website, you can request correction or modification of your information, and download your account information, by following the instructions here . To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity. 5.2 Deleting your Information. If you follow the instructions here (or for Periscope here ), your account will be deactivated. When deactivated, your Twitter account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your Twitter account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. 5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent. You can manage your privacy settings and other account features here . If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your Twitter experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings youâve adjusted. Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as âinterest-based advertisingâ) and respects the DAAâs consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info/ . 5.4 Authorized Agent Requests. To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone elseâs information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact Twitter section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification. How does Twitter handle my information wherever I am? We treat your information fairly, no matter where you live around the world. 6. Your Rights and Ours We provide Twitter to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure Twitter respects local requirements. Expand dropdowns for more information: Â 6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information. Twitter has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, weâd encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing . And no, we donât sell your personal information.Â Â 6.2 We move your data to make Twitter work for you. Just as you use Twitter to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, Twitter must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience â itâs what you expect from us.

        "body": "How Twitter Ads work Skip to main content Business How Twitter Ads work We want to show you ads that you find interesting and useful. Here's an overview of how Twitter Ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings, and other options. What are Twitter Ads? You may see different kinds of ads on Twitter, includingÂ Promoted Ads , Follower Ads , and Trend Takeover . We may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of Twitter. They are clearly marked with a âPromotedâ icon. You can interact with most promoted content in much the same way as organic content. If you follow, like, or Retweet content on Twitter, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content. Why you see certain Twitter Ads Your activity on Twitter, the information you provide to Twitter, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you. When you use Twitter to follow, Tweet, search, view, or interact with Tweets or Twitter accounts, we may use these actions to customize Twitter Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if location features are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer. Twitter may also personalize ads based on information that Twitter and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie ID). This helps Twitter display ads about things youâve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, you could receive a Promoted Ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. You could also see this business as a Follower Ad in one of your \"Who to Follow\" suggestions. Learn more about your Â privacy controls for personalized ads . Managing your privacy settings We're committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. If you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads on and off of Twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature: Using your Twitter settings, visit the \"Personalization and data settings\"Â and adjust the \"Personalize ads\" setting. If you're on web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Allianceâs consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt-out of seeing interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser. On iOS 13 and earlier only, ifÂ you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the âLimit Ad Trackingâ setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions).Â On Android, if you don't want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in Twitter for Android on your current mobile device, enable âOpt out of Ads Personalizationâ in your Android phoneâs settings (precise directions and name of the setting may be different on different Android versions and OEM Android variants). Note: Please confirm that you're logged in if you want to view or change the web settings for your Twitter account. Changing your Twitter settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect behavior on that browser while you're not logged in to Twitter. Learn more about how to access your personalization and data settings , including in your Twitter mobile app. Twitter also works with third-party advertising partners, including Google, to market Twitterâs own services and serve ads on behalf of Twitter advertisers, including through the delivery of interest-based ads. The privacy options described here apply to interest-based ads served by or on Twitter; they do not apply to ads served by these other companies off of Twitter, including on Twitter's behalf. You can learn more about opting out of receiving interest-based ads from other companies at optout.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org/choices .Â If you're on the web, you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâs opt-out browser add-on , and opt-out of interest-based Google ads using Google Ads settings . On iOS version 14 and later only, if you do not want Twitter to access your iOS Identifier for Advertising, disable the âAllow Apps to Request to Trackâ setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions). In addition, whether you're logged in or logged out, you always have the option to \"dismiss\" Promoted Ads and/or accounts that you're not interested in seeing. This feedback helps us show you better promoted content. How can I run Twitter Ads?

That means they should not upload videos they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations. What are Copyright Exceptions? Copyright exceptions are laws that allow you to reuse someone elseâs copyright-protected material without getting their permission, but only under certain circumstances. In the US, the most widely known copyright exception is fair use. When deciding whether a use is fair, courts look at four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. Some activities that may qualify as fair use include criticism, commentary, and news reporting. Fair use aims to promote freedom of expression. In some civil law countries, including many in the EU, more limited exceptions are recognized where the reuse must fall within specific categories, instead of having factors that are weighed. The categories set out in Article 17 of the EU Digital Single Market copyright directive are quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody, and pastiche. These words have their usual meaning in everyday language, but are also enacted into law by each member state and interpreted by both national courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It is also important to consider the context of the use, and the purpose of such copyright exceptions, one of which is to balance creatorsâ freedom of expression, and rightsholders' copyright. In some countries, such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, a hybrid concept of fair dealing exists. Courts weigh factors similar to those in fair use, but reuses must fall within specific categories. These categories include quotation (general quotation, and quotation for the purposes of criticism, review, or news reporting), caricature, parody, and pastiche. Most countries in the world have signed an international treaty known as the Berne Convention, which allows reuses in specific categories, including for quotation, and news reporting. While there are some similarities regarding copyright exceptions across the globe, there are still considerable differences between the laws of each country. Thereâs no one-size-fits-all answer as to whether a reuse falls within copyright exceptions, and the courts decide the applicability of such exceptions on a case-by-case basis. At YouTube, our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. Copyright exceptions play a key role in furthering this mission by supporting the free flow of ideas and creativity. Therefore, we ask rightsholders to consider the applicability of copyright exceptions before they submit copyright removal requests. We believe this would strike a balance between respecting the copyright of rightsholders, and creatorsâ freedom of expression that may be protected by copyright exceptions. In addition, we build products that empower creators to access, create, and share information like never before. Weâve created an Audio Library for you to discover free high-quality music and sound effects that you can reuse safely. Now with YouTube Shorts, you can create short videos sampling someone elseâs content , provided they have given you permission to do so. We're also continuing to build and expand Creator Music , which lets creators in the YouTube Partner program safely use commercial music by licensing tracks or sharing their video revenue with music rights holders. Resources Learn more about Fair Use How can rights holders make copyright claims? Everyone has access to YouTubeâs Copyright Management Tools, which gives rights holders control of their copyrighted material on YouTube. We work with rights holders to match them to appropriate features based on the scale of their copyrighted content on YouTube, and the resources theyâve dedicated to responsibly manage their content online.  Our Copyright Management Suite provides a number of ways rights holders can make copyright claims. Webform The simplest way to have unauthorized copies of copyrighted content removed is by manually submitting a copyright notification through our DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) webform . This tool is best for most users - it is open to everyone, and available in every language. Copyright Match Tool The Copyright Match Tool uses the power of Content ID matching technology to find re-uploads of videos on YouTube. Available to over 1,500,000 channels, it identifies near-full reuploads of a Creatorâs original videos on other YouTube channels and allows the Creator to choose an action to take: they can request the removal of the video, message the uploader of the video, or simply archive the match if they do not want to take any action. Any user with a demonstrated history of successful DMCA takedowns via our webform can apply for access using our public form. Content ID Content ID is our solution for those with the most complex rights management needs. It is our digital fingerprinting system that allows rightholders to upload content they have exclusive rights to as reference files, and then scans videos uploaded to YouTube for matches of that content. When a user uploads content, Content ID scans against the database for matching videos. If there is a match, then an action is taken based on the predefined rules or policies that a content owner sets themselves: Block a whole video from being viewed. Creators do not receive a copyright strike if the content owner blocks a video. Monetize the video by running ads against it; in some cases sharing revenue with the uploader. Track the video's viewership statistics. In most cases, this means that rights holders donât need to submit copyright takedowns for these videos and instead have the opportunity to monetize and run ads in exchange for the videos being live. Resources Learn more about YouTubeâs Copyright Management Tools Learn more about copyright strike What action does YouTube take for copyright infringement? If a copyright owner submits a valid DMCA complaint through our webform, we take down that video and apply a copyright strike . If a user gets three copyright strikes in 90 days, their account, along with any associated channels, will be terminated. We also have tools to help Creators resolve their copyright strikes - including waiting for it to expire after 90 days, requesting a retraction, or submitting a counter notification. Content ID works differently. If a match between a reference file and a new upload is made, a âclaimâ is made. Based on the preference selected by the Content ID owner, weâll apply a policy to track, monetize, or block, but will not issue a copyright strike.

Creator basics: how to set up and customize\n                                  your channel There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We\n                              offer up different formats and functionalities,\n                              giving you the flexibility to create everything\n                              from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60\n                              seconds or less, to longer form videos. No matter what youâre creating, youâll need to\n                              start by creating a YouTube Channel. First you need to sign into YouTube using a\n                                Google Account. Once youâre signed in, click âCreate Accountâ,\n                                and choose whether itâs for you or for your\n                                business. You can then create a YouTube channel on your\n                                account, upload videos, leave comments, and\n                                create Shorts and playlists. Next, youâll want to upload your videos! Uploading is easy. You just sign into your\n                                YouTube account and then click on the âCreateâ\n                                icon. If youâre planning to upload a longer form\n                                video, select âupload videoâ and then choose\n                                your desired video file - you can upload 15\n                                files at a time! If youâd like to upload a YouTube Short , youâll need to be signed into YouTube mobile,\n                                where youâll tap âCreateâ and then âCreate a\n                                Shortâ. From here you can either upload a video\n                                from your camera roll or create using our suite\n                                of lightweight tools. Help your videos stand out & keep viewers\n                                  watching Growing your channel is all about creating videos\n                              viewers want to watch and accurately presenting\n                              them to the audience. When doing so, hereâs a few\n                              tips to keep in mind. With each video, think carefully about the title,\n                              description, and thumbnail you plan to use - these should all accurately\n                              reflect your content and let viewers know what\n                              they can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts\n                              creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of\n                              your content can grab viewers scrolling through\n                              the video feed! Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect\n                              their attention via hashtags, playlists , cards , end screens , and more. Navigating YouTube Studio YouTube Studio is your home base for posting\n                              videos and making edits to your channel. To update\n                              your channelâs basic info like name, profile picture , and banner, just log in and tap âCustomisationâ\n                              to see your options. You can also make changes to your channel using\n                              the Studio Mobile app. You can tap âYour Channelâ\n                              and then âEdit Channelâ to update and edit how\n                              your channel looks to your viewers.

Applicable Terms Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies which may be updated from time to time (together, this \"Agreement\" ). Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content.

The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to: access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders; circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage with, or otherwise interfere with any part of the Service (or attempt to do any of these things), including security-related features or features that (a) prevent or restrict the copying or other use of Content or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content; access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except (a) in the case of public search engines, in accordance with YouTube’s robots.txt file; or (b) with YouTube’s prior written permission; collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames or faces), unless permitted by that person or allowed under section (3) above; use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations; cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a video’s views, likes, or dislikes, or to increase a channel’s subscribers, or otherwise manipulate metrics in any manner; misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or frivolous submissions; run contests on or through the Service that do not comply with YouTube’s contest policies and guidelines ; use the Service to view or listen to Content other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, you may not publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or use the Service to (a) sell any advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on, around, or within the Service or Content, other than those allowed in the Advertising on YouTube policies (such as compliant product placements); or (b) sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage where YouTube videos are the main draw for users visiting the webpage). Reservation Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube. Develop, Improve and Update the Service YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout , subject to applicable law and policies. Your Content and Conduct Uploading Content If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines ) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content. Rights you Grant You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below. License to YouTube By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service. License to Other Users You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service. Duration of License The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. Right to Monetize You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting November 18, 2020, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments. Remov ing Your Content You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms. Removal of Content By YouTube If any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center. Community Guidelines Strikes YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the YouTube Community Guidelines . Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.   A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the Community Guidelines Strikes Basics page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may appeal here . If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service. Copyright Protection We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center . If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice . We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center , where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service. Account Suspension & Termination Terminations by You You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first. Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe that there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Notice for Termination or Suspension We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Effect of Account Suspension or Termination If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can appeal using this form . About Software in the Service Downloadable Software When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission. Open Source Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses. Other Legal Terms Warranty Disclaimer OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND YOUTUBE DOES NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT: (A) THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE; (B) THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE SERVICE, OR ITS ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT YOU SUBMIT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE ON THE SERVICE. Limitation of Liability EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUTUBE, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS; LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA; INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS; PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAUSED BY: ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES ON THE SERVICE; PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE; ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE; ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF THE SERVICE; ANY VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CODE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; ANY CONTENT WHETHER SUBMITTED BY A USER OR YOUTUBE, INCLUDING YOUR USE OF CONTENT; AND/OR THE REMOVAL OR UNAVAILABILITY OF ANY CONTENT. THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM ASSERTED IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT YOUTUBE HAS PAID TO YOU FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF YOUR NOTICE, IN WRITING TO YOUTUBE, OF THE CLAIM; AND (B) USD $500. Indemnity To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Service. Third-Party Links The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you visit. About this Agreement Changing this Agreement We may change this Agreement, for example, (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business - for example, when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new product or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove any Content you uploaded and stop using the Service. Continuation of this Agreement If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “Other Legal Terms”, “About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue as described under “Duration of License”. Severance If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms. No Waiver If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future). Interpretation In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes. Governing Law All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service will be governed by California law, except California’s conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. You and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. Limitation on Legal Action YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. Effective as of January 5, 2022 ( view previous version )"

For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode.

To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms . And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us . Information Google collects We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful , the people who matter most to you online , or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information . Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address , crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps , your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name , crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device . Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages , we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS and other sensor data from your device IP address Activity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work Information about things near your device , such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information . In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources . For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse . We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf . We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies , pixel tags , local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches , databases, and server logs . Why Google collects data We use data to build better services We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: Provide our services We use your information to deliver our services , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. Maintain & improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results . For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center . We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos. We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. Go to My Ad Center Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services. Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public . We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. Your privacy controls You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device. Sharing your information When you share your information Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search. When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting . When Google shares your information We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases: With your consent We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information . With domain administrators If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request . We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report .

Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users , or the public as required or permitted by law. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Keeping your information secure We build security into our services to protect your information All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected. We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including: We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing , Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it.

And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping. When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase. detect abuse When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities. devices For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account. ensure and improve For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads. ensure our services are working as intended For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly. Information about things near your device If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more legal process, or enforceable governmental request Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report . make improvements For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone. may link information Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more our users For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more . partner with Google There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more payment information For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this. We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more personalized ads You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more phone number If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more protect against abuse For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account). publicly accessible sources For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services. rely on cookies to function properly For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more safety and reliability Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more sensitive categories When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services. Sensor data from your device Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. servers around the world For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users. services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages Examples of these services include: Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls Gmail, for sending and receiving emails Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages Google Fi, for a phone plan show trends When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more specific Google services For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store. specific partners For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information. synced with your Google Account Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more the people who matter most to you online For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently . the public For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices. third parties For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you. Views and interactions with content and ads For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears. Voice and audio information For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more your activity on other sites and apps This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. Our Community Guidelines are a key part of our broader suite of policies and are regularly updated in consultation with outside experts and YouTube creators to keep pace with emerging challenges. We enforce these Community Guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and machine learning, and apply them to everyone equallyâregardless of the subject or the creatorâs background, political viewpoint, position, or affiliation. Our policies aim to make YouTube a safer community while still giving creators the freedom to share a broad range of experiences and perspectives. What areas do Community Guidelines cover? You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below: Spam & deceptive practices Fake engagement Impersonation External links Spam, deceptive practices & scams Playlists Additional policies Sensitive content Child safety Thumbnails Nudity and sexual content Suicide and self-harm Vulgar language Violent or dangerous content Harassment and cyberbullying Harmful or dangerous content Hate speech Violent criminal organizations Violent or graphic content Regulated goods Firearms Sale of illegal or regulated goods or services Misinformation Misinformation Elections misinformation COVID-19 medical misinformation Vaccine misinformation In addition to Community Guidelines, creators who want to monetize content on YouTube must comply with Monetization Policies . How does YouTube develop new policies and update existing ones? Each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent, well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world. Theyâre developed in consultation with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators. New policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently. This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice. How does YouTube enforce its Community Guidelines? 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Thatâs a lot of content, which is why our teams come together to make sure that what you see on our platform follows our Community Guidelines. To do that, we combine the power of advanced machine learning systems and our community itself to flag potentially problematic content. Our expert reviewers then remove flagged content that violates our Community Guidelines. How does YouTube identify content that violates Community Guidelines? With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content weâve already removed, even before itâs viewed. We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue. Is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content? The YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate. If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can use our flagging feature to submit content for review. We developed the YouTube Trusted Flagger program to provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area and government agencies. Participants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust & Safety specialists. Videos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed. They are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams. NGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies. How does YouTube treat educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content? Sometimes videos that might otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may be allowed to stay on YouTube if the content offers a compelling reason with visible context for viewers. We often refer to this exception as âEDSA,â which stands for âEducational, Documentary, Scientific or Artisticâ. To help determine whether a video might qualify for an EDSA exception, we look at multiple factors, including the video title, descriptions, and the context provided. EDSA exceptions are a critical way we make sure that important speech stays on YouTube, while protecting the wider YouTube ecosystem from harmful content. Resources Read more about how we treat EDSA content on YouTube What action does YouTube take for content that violates Community Guidelines? Machine learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content weâve already reviewed and determined violates our policies. YouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers. They assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose. Our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Reviewers' inputs are then used to train and improve the accuracy of our systems at a much larger scale. Community Guidelines Strikes If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the Creator. The first time a Creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel. After one warning, weâll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams, or stories for a 1-week period. Channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated. Channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes system and be terminated. All strikes and terminations can be appealed if the Creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision. Resources Learn more about Community Guidelines strikes Appeal a Community Guidelines strike Age-Restricting Content Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines, but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. In these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who have Restricted Mode enabled. Creators can also choose to age restrict their own content at upload if they think itâs not suitable for younger audiences.

A campus map and virtual tour software is a digital platform that provides a comprehensive\n                                                   and interactive representation of a college or university campus. It typically includes\n                                                   an interactive map with location markers, 360-degree panoramic views, photos, videos,\n                                                   and additional information about the institution's facilities, programs, and services.\n                                                   This software works by utilizing advanced mapping and imaging technology to create\n                                                   a user-friendly, immersive virtual experience of the campus, allowing visitors to\n                                                   explore and navigate the institution's facilities from anywhere in the world. What are the benefits of using campus map and virtual tour software? There are several benefits of using campus map and virtual tour software for your\n                                                      institution. For one, it helps increase your institution's visibility and accessibility,\n                                                      making it easier for prospective students, parents, and other stakeholders to explore\n                                                      and learn about your campus facilities and offerings. Additionally, it provides an\n                                                      engaging and interactive way to showcase your institution's unique features, programs,\n                                                      and amenities, and can help you stand out from other competing schools. Virtual tours\n                                                      can also save time and resources by reducing the number of in-person campus visits\n                                                      required for students and their families, particularly for those who are unable to\n                                                      travel to your campus. Can I customize the map and virtual tour software to match my school's branding and\n                                             color scheme? Yes, most campus map and virtual tour software providers offer customization options,\n                                                   allowing you to incorporate your school's branding, logo, colors, and other visual\n                                                   elements into the virtual tour. This ensures that the software aligns with your institution's\n                                                   unique identity and branding, and creates a consistent user experience for visitors. Is it possible to include interactive features such as videos, images, and 360-degree\n                                             panoramic views in the virtual tour? Yes, most campus map and virtual tour software offer a range of interactive features\n                                                   that can be incorporated into the virtual tour, including videos, images, and 360-degree\n                                                   panoramic views. This allows visitors to explore the campus facilities in more detail\n                                                   and gain a better understanding of the institution's offerings. Interactive features\n                                                   can also help engage visitors and create a more immersive experience, making it easier\n                                                   for them to visualize themselves as part of the campus community.

And Presence\n                                    alleviated many of the headaches that I feared would come from it. The pandemic has\n                                    presented major challenges to all of us—students and staff—but the tools that I’ve\n                                    been able to learn and customize through Presence have brought us many unexpected\n                                    rewards.\" Marqueece Holifield | Associate Director of Student Engagement -  National Louis University “ We’re an urban campus, and we have a high number of commuter students. So we face\n                                    some challenges when it comes to engaging students on campus.

This is\n                                    how I can go find an event.’ It’s helping out our students in being able to get connected,\n                                    being able to find communities where they belong. It’s really made student buy-in\n                                    much easier than with other platforms — how intuitive it is. And because so many students\n                                    are trying it out and then using it all the time, we get access to bigger, better\n                                    data and can really streamline our processes for student orgs and engagement all across\n                                    the board.\" Dan Welter | Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life -  Washington State University “ Our job is to serve students, to improve their experience.

The determination of residency for tuition purposes affects whether a student pays in-state or out-of-state tuition fees. Out-of-state tuition fees are higher than in-state tuition fees. Just because a student is or has been a resident of the State of California does not mean that he or she qualifies to receive the in-state tuition rate. Certain requirements, established under California law, must be met. Your campus admissions office will make the determination of residency status based on the information you provide, including information provided on the Application for Admission and/or the CSU Residence Questionnaire. You must contact the campus to receive a final determination of residency status. It is the responsibility of the student to verify all fee balances prior to the start of the term. Out-of-state tuition will be charged if the student did not meet the residency or Non-Resident Tuition Exemption (AB540) requirements. If a student paid out-of-state tuition in previous terms, the CSU is unable to grant retroactive requests or change residency status as evidence of California residency was not provided to the campus by the stated deadlines.

Although I've lived here many years, I didn't know about the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area until I hiked to Sandstone Peak about 10 years ago. All this national park land all around me and I didn't even know about it. Wouldn't it be great if more people experienced the outdoors? In 2017 I saw a post by Latino Outdoors, inviting us to hike the Backbone Trail, the premier hiking trail in the Santa Monica Mountains. I was thrilled to be selected to be part of this group that hiked eight segments of the backbone trail with park rangers and volunteers. If you're interested in hiking the Backbone Trail, I highly recommend it, but being prepared is key. That's why the National Park Service is coming out with a series of videos for folks interested in hiking a segment of the trail or all 67 miles of it from Point Mugu to Will Rogers State Historic Park. The series will cover logistical issues and what to bring, and break down the eight segments of the trail that you can follow, along with valuable insights from park rangers on natural and cultural resources along the way. I hope you can check it out, see you on the trails. Visit our keyboard shortcuts docs for details Duration: 2 minutes, 27 seconds Ready for an adventure?\nAs you know, some paths in life are better taken in dirt so come along with us as we hike the 67-mile-long Backbone Trail in the beautiful Santa Monica Mountains.\nEach week the video series, broken up into eight segments and hosted by longtime volunteer Ralph Waycott, will introduce you to LA’s premier hike.\nShare your questions, trail experiences, tips or thoughts about this video series with us by emailing samo_interpretation@nps.gov. Click here for the full video series. Visit our Maps and Information page to learn about the different trail sections. Learn more by visiting our FAQ's page . About the Backbone Trail You will see how many public and private agencies, organizations and individuals have joined together to create Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in general and the Backbone Trail which has been designated as a National Recreation Trail.

You can increase your knowledge by attending programs and lectures listed in our calendar . You can contribute your time by becoming a State or National Park Service volunteer .

As hikers on this trail you will enjoy the Mediterranean ecosystem, found only in five places in the world, experiencing its many unique plant and animal communities. By being able to escape from city life, you enjoy the health benefits of hiking and learning a lot about our own unique area. You will also learn some history of the area through the trail as you travel through Coastal Sage Scrub, Chaparral, Oak Woodlands, Meadows, and Streamside areas. If you have read through the Backbone Trail (BBT) information and still have questions, contact us . Full text displayed on the infographic here: Welcome to the Backbone Trail!

Dismiss View all alerts Contact Us Rancho Sierra Vista/ Satwiwa Two threads of local history intertwine to establish the identity of Rancho Sierra Vista/ Satwiwa. Ranch structures and introduced grasses represent over a century of ranching, while native plants reflect an environment that Chumash Indians lived in for thousands of years. The gentle slopes yield trails that picnickers, hikers, bikers, and equestrians enjoy during every season. Big Sycamore Canyon Trail descends from Satwiwa to the Pacific Ocean along a historic Chumash trade route. The Satwiwa Loop Trail is designated for hikers only, and meanders through an area considered sacred by the Chumash. Keep an eye out for deer and coyote in the coastal sage scrub, hawks and falcons soaring overhead, and sweeping views of Boney Mountain and Sycamore Canyon. Follow all trail guidelines by only biking or horseback riding on designated trails. The May 2013 Springs Fire burned much of Point Mugu State Park and portions of Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa. Whether recreating on foot, bike or horseback, be on the lookout for signs of plants, soil, and animals recovering from the effects of this wildfire. Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa features the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center (open on weekends from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). Native Americans, representing Native cultures from throughout the United States, lead workshops, presentations, and art shows throughout the year.

The following bio security regulations and guidelines can help prevent the introduction and spread of nonnative species before they become a problem. To prevent the introduction of nonnative species, the following items may not be brought to the park: Live or Potted Plants, Soil, Cut  Flowers, Firewood or any untreated, unfinished wood (including hiking sticks), Corrugated boxes, Tools or equipment with attached soil, Motorized vehicles, Bicycles This restriction action is necessitated for the protection of the islands unique values, ecological systems and protection of breeding populations of marine mammals, endangered species of seabirds, eagles, islands foxes and other unique and rare species of flora and fauna inhabiting the Channel Islands National Park. Less restrictive measures would have the potential for introduction of nonnative species that could adversely effect many species and/or endanger the islands ecosystems.

The CIBC provides educational and recreational opportunities for youth and adults of Ventura County, CSU Channel Islands community and others from around the State. While the main focus of the Center is to teach boating skills and support boaters, the CIBC also provides other educational resources on the local marine environment. The CSU Channel Islands Boating Center is housed in the Division of Student Affairs at California State University Channel Islands. Our Division and staff within the Division, including the CIBC staff have the following message: “The Division of Student Affairs at California State University Channel Islands stands with Black people and affirms that ALL BLACK LIVES MATTER, and we believe that it is our collective responsibility to reject anti-Blackness rhetoric and all forms of explicit and implicit racism in our society. This is both an internal and external process, where we have to challenge ourselves, our communities, and systematic racism to secure our collective co-liberation. With this in mind, we share this Racial Healing & Educational Resource Guide to help us along this movement towards social justice.” ___________________________________________________________________________________ Learn more about the CIBC >> Upcoming Events CIBC 2023 Spring Schedule Summer Youth Programming: Register Now!

VCTC buses have both front-mounted bike racks and/or undercarriage luggage compartments. Only bikes with 3” tires or less fit in the front racks.

Reservation Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube. Develop, Improve and Update the Service YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout , subject to applicable law and policies. Your Content and Conduct Uploading Content If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines ) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content. Rights you Grant You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below. License to YouTube By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service. License to Other Users You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service. Duration of License The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. Right to Monetize You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting November 18, 2020, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments. Remov ing Your Content You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms. Removal of Content By YouTube If any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center. Community Guidelines Strikes YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the YouTube Community Guidelines . Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.   A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the Community Guidelines Strikes Basics page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may appeal here . If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service. Copyright Protection We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center . If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice . We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center , where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service. Account Suspension & Termination Terminations by You You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first. Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe that there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Notice for Termination or Suspension We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Effect of Account Suspension or Termination If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can appeal using this form . About Software in the Service Downloadable Software When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission. Open Source Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses. Other Legal Terms Warranty Disclaimer OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND YOUTUBE DOES NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT: (A) THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE; (B) THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE SERVICE, OR ITS ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT YOU SUBMIT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE ON THE SERVICE.

THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM ASSERTED IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT YOUTUBE HAS PAID TO YOU FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF YOUR NOTICE, IN WRITING TO YOUTUBE, OF THE CLAIM; AND (B) USD $500. Indemnity To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Service. Third-Party Links The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you visit. About this Agreement Changing this Agreement We may change this Agreement, for example, (1) to reflect changes to our Service or how we do business - for example, when we add new products or features or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new product or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove any Content you uploaded and stop using the Service. Continuation of this Agreement If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “Other Legal Terms”, “About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue as described under “Duration of License”. Severance If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms. No Waiver If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future). Interpretation In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes. Governing Law All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service will be governed by California law, except California’s conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. You and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms . And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us . Information Google collects We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful , the people who matter most to you online , or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information . Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers , browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address , crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps , your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name , crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device . Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages , we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS and other sensor data from your device IP address Activity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work Information about things near your device , such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information . In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources . For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse . We also receive information from advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf . We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies , pixel tags , local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches , databases, and server logs . Why Google collects data We use data to build better services We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: Provide our services We use your information to deliver our services , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. Maintain & improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results . For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center . We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos. We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. Go to My Ad Center Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services. Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public . We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. Your privacy controls You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup , which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide . Go to Privacy Checkup Managing, reviewing, and updating your information When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
