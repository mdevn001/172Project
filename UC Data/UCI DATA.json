Brilliant Future. In 2016, UC Irvine released a bold new strategic plan to build on our campus strengths and realize our brilliant future. The plan was developed over many months of campus consultation and is based on four pillars. We remain committed to the overarching vision of this strategic plan. Over the past seven years, many of the specific goals outlined within these pillars have been accomplished , and many strategies relevant at that time require adjustment and refocus in light of new circumstances and opportunities. Consequently, in 2022, Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Hal Stern charged a group of faculty and administrators from across the campus with refreshing our strategic plan in a way that will guide the campus in making strategic investments of time and resources over the next five years. We invite you to explore our updated strategic plan.

Movies: Empire of the Ants, Antz, and Ant Man TV : UC Irvine sporting events of course! The History of the Anteater at UC Irvine It was 1965 and freshman ruled the newly established UC Irvine campus. Just 12 days after the first day of classes, UCI's men's water polo team beat Cal Poly in front of a crowd of 900 students. The triumph made it abundantly clear: UCI needed a mascot. Water polo players Pat Glasgow and Bob Ernst, unimpressed by mascot suggestions from university administration, proposed the anteater idea to some friends. As fans of Johnny Hart's comic strip \"B.C.,\" which featured an anteater who cried \"ZOT!\" the long-nosed, bushy-tailed mammal seemed to be a natural choice. With the help of their peers, the water polo players successfully lobbied for the Anteater mascot. And on Nov. 30, 1965 - the Anteater emerged victorious with some 56 percent of the vote, beating out alternatives such as the unicorns, sea hawks, toros, bison, centaurs, roadrunners and \"none of these.\" Peter the Anteater has had a lot of memorable moments over the years, from breaking world records to rubbing elbows with politicians and even taking a ride on the Space Shuttle Endeavor. Through all the excitement, his favorite pastime is pumping up the crowd at a big game. Today, the Anteater and his vicious battle cry \"ZOT!\" is synonymous with UCI. The campus has embraced the mascot with Zot codes, Zotmail, anteater statues, a campus store called the Zot-N-Go, and a student spirit group known as the Antourage, the most enthusiastic members of the 'Eater Nation. The 'Eater Nation is partial to Peter the Anteater, but we're not alone in our sentiments. UCI's mascot has a pristine reputation for pumping-up the crowd and securing the adoration of people across the nation. Anteater Accolades Mashable's 2015 NCAA Tournament Mascot Madness Champion Reader's Digest ranked Peter among nation's most lovable mascots. 2020 Tokyodachi Mascot Mania Winner See Peter go nose to nose with late night host Conan O'Brien . Mascot makeovers No doubt about it: Peter the Anteater is the face of UCI. And what a face it is!

Please check with your department to verify. Below is the program GRE requirement list. Validity Dates and Timing GRE test results are not valid for more than five years. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. At the time of test registration, students must notify the Educational Testing Service to report scores directly to UCI. Scores reported by a student cannot be accepted.

Box 6000 Princeton, NJ 08541-6000; Telephone: (609) 771-7670. English Language Proficiency Requirements for Admission TOEFL or IELTS All graduate applicants are required to demonstrate English proficiency for admissions consideration. Applicants are waived from the English Language Proficiency requirement if they have earned an undergraduate or master’s degree from an institution at which English was the sole language of instruction according to the World Higher Education Database (WHED) . Please see WHED’s instructions on how to search for your institution. If English is not the sole language of instruction listed or if no language is listed at all, the waiver does not apply and the applicant is required to take and pass an approved English proficiency test.  Approved tests and minimum scores are outlined in the next section. Please note: Test results that are two years old or older are not acceptable. IMPORTANT NOTE: If a student will be supported as a Teaching Assistant (TA) by their program, please read the English proficiency requirement policy for Teaching Assistantships . Some programs require students who have not earned an undergraduate degree from an institution at which English was the sole language of instruction according to WHED to demonstrate English language proficiency to serve as a TA when they apply to the program. Please check with the program(s) to which you intend to apply for individual requirements. TOEFL The TOEFL is administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Please select institution code 4859 to have your official score sent to UCI. No department code is needed. We only accept scores submitted electronically by ETS. Test results that are two years old or older are not acceptable . We do not accept MyBest scores; you must submit all individual test scores. Results of institutional (non-ETS) administrations of the TOEFL are not acceptable . We will accept the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition test.  The same minimum score applies.

For more information, please visit their website at www.ielts.org IELTS Score Requirements for Admission Consideration: An overall minimum score of 7 for admission, with a score of no less than 6 on any individual module. Remediation If the head of a unit or appropriate delegate finds sufficient grounds to believe that any graduate student appointed as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate does not have spoken English proficiency adequate for undergraduate instruction, they must require the student to undertake a remediation process, in consultation with the Program in Global Languages & Communication and approved by the student’s academic unit, prior to additional appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate. Such a determination should be made on the grounds of inadequate proficiency alone (as indicated in student evaluations, faculty observations, or the like). This remediation process will be required regardless of how the student was initially certified for oral English proficiency (that is, regardless of earning an undergraduate degree at an institution where English was the sole language of instruction or by achieving a passing score on one of the tests noted above). Process for consulting with the Program in Global Languages and Communication regarding a remediation process for a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate: The graduate program requesting consultation regarding a remediation process for a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate who is believed to not have spoken English proficiency adequate for undergraduate instruction should email TOEP@uci.edu with the following information: (1) the student’s information (name, UCI ID number, email address), and (2) the contact information (email) of the delegate from the hiring department who is requesting the consultation and/or overseeing the remediation process for the student. The staff in the Program in Global Languages and Communication will then contact the student to set up an appointment during which the student will meet with an Academic Coordinator in the GLC Program who will review, discuss, and/or assess the student’s oral English proficiency. After meeting with the student, the GLC Program will provide a recommendation for a remediation plan to the delegate from the hiring department and the student’s home department/program. Letters of Recommendation You are required to have three letters of recommendation submitted on your behalf. The letters should be submitted by instructors in a discipline related to your proposed field of study who are in a position to analyze your abilities and academic promise. Access to Letters of Recommendation The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 gives students (persons admitted and enrolled), the right to inspect letters of recommendation written in support of applications for admission. The law also permits students to waive that right if they choose, although such a waiver must be voluntary and cannot be a condition of admission, award, or employment. Waiving your right of access to the letters of recommendation is optional. However, the Admissions Committee cannot use letters of recommendation intended by the recommender to be confidential unless the applicant waives access by signing the Waiver of Access statement. The process for “waiving access” or “declining to waive access” is described below. Online Submission For the Applicant Complete the Letter of Recommendation section on the online application. This will allow you to enter in your recommenders’ names and e-mail addresses. An automated e-mail invitation will be sent to each of your recommenders. It is strongly recommended that you waive or decline to waive your rights of access to your letters of recommendation. After you have completed and submitted your application, you may continue to manage and monitor the status of their submission by logging into your online application and viewing the status page. Please note that you can submit the application prior to all your letters of recommendations are received, but check with your program to verify the deadline of when all the letters need to be received. The application will accept Interfolio. If you need any support or have questions regarding Interfolio, please contact them directly at https://www.interfolio.com/contact/ . We do not accept paper recommendation letters. Your recommenders must submit the letters via the recommendation form that is sent to them via email. For the Recommender Your student will provide your contact information on their application which will generate an automated e-mail inviting you to log in and complete a recommendation form. Please follow the steps on the form and submit your recommendation for their application. The form will support document uploads or you may copy and paste the text of your letter.  We do not accept paper recommendation letters. Transcripts For application review purposes only, scan and upload copies of transcripts for all institutions attended since high school. In the online application, you will be prompted to upload your scanned documents. Please upload both the front and back sides of the transcript. Uploaded transcripts should be recent and include the following: your name, dates of attendance, grades/marks received, credits and grading legend. UCI reserves the right to require official transcripts at any time during the admission process, and rescind any offer of admission made if discrepancies between uploaded and official transcript(s) are found. Official transcripts will be requested if and when you are admitted and decide to attend UCI. Do not send official transcripts until this time, unless you are requested to do so. Supplemental Materials Some programs require submission of additional materials; please contact your program of interest to determine if any additional materials are required. Application Deadlines Application deadlines differ by program, so please determine the deadline for your program by visiting your program of interest in the Degree Programs section of the website. You must supply a valid e-mail address that you will maintain at least 8 months after you apply. If you are admitted, you will be notified via this e-mail address. Disclaimer Applicants are expected to complete their UC application completely and accurately, and the truthfulness of that information is at the core of all admissions decisions. Falsified application information may include but is not limited to: making inaccurate statements on the application, withholding information requested on the application, giving false information, or submitting fraudulent or falsified documents in support of an admissions application. Proper submission of official materials is also of utmost importance. Letters of recommendation must be submitted by the letter writer; an applicant must not submit a letter of recommendation on behalf of the letter writer. In cases where an applicant has submitted incomplete or inaccurate information on their UCI application, or fraudulently submitted official application materials on behalf of another individual or institution, the matter will be reviewed as a case of falsification and will result in the cancellation of the application or the withdrawal of an admission offer. Please note that once submitted, your application materials will not, under any circumstances, be returned to you or forwarded to another entity on your behalf.

Image Human Dimensions of Science and Technology Humanists at UCI illuminate the human dimensions of science, technology and the environment. We examine the changes that the sciences and technology have brought to our species, including the ways we have imagined and represented these changes through philosophy, literature, and visual art. Image Philosophy and Critical Theory Humanists at UCI explore and challenge what humans think and know. Philosophy and theory help us ask questions about ourselves, what we take for granted, and the distinctions between truth, falsity and error.

Sherwood Rowland, accepted Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry, marking the first time a public university received the prestigious award in two fields within the same year. Reines was recognized for discovering the neutrino, a new elementary particle of nature that was thought to be undetectable. Rowland’s prize was for the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer, work that sparked a worldwide and triumphant effort to close the ozone hole. Taken together, these efforts are emblematic of the broad mission of this school: to uncover fundamental truths and to provide transformative discoveries that tangibly improve the world. Reines, who was also our founding dean, said he was motivated by the fact that “everybody said you couldn’t do it.” This undeterred, unbending spirit continues to flourish to this day. read more Flagship Projects The UCI School of Physical Sciences advances humanity through a deeper understanding of the physical science that governs the world.

Brilliant future The Campaign for UCI The School of Physical Sciences plays a vital role in Brilliant Future: the campaign for UCI. We seek a historic philanthropic commitment – a school naming gift. Funding of this magnitude will empower the school to elevate its strong academics and research to elite levels of excellence. A naming gift would ensure that we are able to grow our flagship projects, hire the most dynamic and modern faculty to support our students and research growth, provide premier research facilities, attract and support the best students, and deliver comprehensive innovation through intellectual property protection and commercialization. A naming gift would honor the intrepid spirit and interdisciplinary innovation at the heart of our school. Additionally, the impact of a naming gift for Physical Sciences at UCI will have the ability to completely transform our school. Our 50+ years of precedence has established a prestigious level of scientific tradition while allowing great flexibility in shaping future outcomes for our school.

UROP is pleased to announce that 340 undergraduate student researchers received recognition and/or funding through our spring and summer Calls for Proposals. Scroll down What is UROP? The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), housed within the Office of the Vice Provost of Teaching and Learning, assists undergraduate students from ANY academic discipline to find research and creative on-campus opportunities with UCI faculty, or off-campus opportunities with industrial partners, national labs, and other universities. We also provide grants to support UCI faculty-mentored undergraduate research projects and creative activities during the academic year and summer. Getting Started New to UROP? It’s easy to get started by doing the following: 1. Attend a Workshop or watch the workshop recordings to learn about your options.  Then use these tools to help you choose: How to Get Involved in Research Worksheet Faculty Profile System and Google Scholar Sample Faculty Email 2.

Schedule an appointment with one of our UROP Advisors today! Ready to get started? Learn More! Contact Us Student Spotlight Fill out a survey to be considered for a future UROP Student Spotlight Nicholas Choi Nicholas Choi, a Mechanical Engineering major, describes himself as a hands-on learner, so getting involved in a research lab that allowed him to see the results of what he has learned has been a great part of his undergraduate education. He says, “my research changed my college life. It allowed me to confront challenging research questions and gave me a lot of confidence to achieve more.” Nicholas has demonstrated his passion for undergraduate research by serving as a 2022–2023 UROP Ambassador. What advice would you give to a student interested in pursuing a faculty-mentored undergraduate research project or creative activity? “Know that you are capable and try your best! Think about your passions and chose your research topic in an area that will help you grow.” Faculty Spotlight Fill out a survey to be considered for a future UROP Faculty Spotlight Professor Abraham Qavi Abraham Qavi, Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, took part in research as an undergraduate at UCI. Since those experiences, he has tried to mentor undergraduate researchers at all levels of his career training. He recommends undergraduate research to help students refine their writing and communication skills, take ownership of their projects, and prepare for rigorous graduate and professional programs. What do you look for and what are your expectations of undergraduates you select to conduct research under your guidance? “I do not have requirements in terms of course work or knowledge coming into the lab—part of the joy of research is learning about new topics. With that said, having a growth mindset will enable researchers to really embrace the process and enjoy science!” What recommendations and advice would you give students embarking on undergraduate research or creative projects? “Be sure to find a laboratory that fits both your scientific interests as well as working styles. Every laboratory will have a different culture, and finding the right fit is incredibly important for your happiness and productivity throughout the process.” The Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning is Composed of: Division of Undergraduate Education Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation Division of Summer Session UC Irvine Homepage University of California Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program University of California, Irvine Irvine, CA 92697-5685 urop@uci.edu © 2023 UC Regents"

This Engineering+ expansion is made possible by a $50 million gift from Susan and Henry Samueli. Steve Zylius / UCI Irvine, Calif., June 5, 2023 — The creation of three new multidisciplinary research institutes in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering is being made possible by a $50 million gift from Susan and Henry Samueli to the University of California, Irvine. Unified under the banner “Engineering+,” the Engineering+Health Institute, Engineering+Society Institute and Engineering+Environment Institute will allow researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct transformational research addressing the most important issues facing humanity today. In addition, a portion of the gift will be used to create the Office of Inreach, dedicated to the well-being, academic success, sense of belonging and career opportunities for undergraduate students in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. “The enduring generosity of Henry and Susan Samueli has enabled University of California, Irvine researchers to seek answers to the most challenging questions and make breakthroughs that impact all our lives,” said UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman. “The investments the Samuelis have made in UCI over nearly a quarter century – bridging engineering, health, interdisciplinary research and student success – have paid substantial dividends in our institution, our community and the world.” Susan and Henry Samueli have made the largest gifts to UCI in the university’s history, including a $200 million donation to create the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences; $30 million to fund the construction of the Samueli Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building; a $20 million naming gift to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering; and the most recent $50 million to support the establishment of three Engineering+ institutes to address challenges in health, society and the environment. Steve Zylius / UCI Susan and Henry Samueli have made the largest gifts to UCI in the institution’s history. In 2017, they pledged $200 million to create the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. A $30 million gift from the Samueli Foundation funded the construction of the Samueli Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building. In 1999, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering received a $20 million naming gift that, in part, endowed 10 chairs and professorships and funded two scholarships and a graduate fellowship. This donation was critical to the trajectory of the engineering school, which has grown significantly in both scope and size since the turn of the millennium: Faculty increased from 105 members in 1999 to 162 in 2023; the undergraduate population jumped from about 1,600 to over 3,500; and the graduate student body more than tripled from about 300 to over 1,050. These changes highlight the transformational nature of the gift, as it enabled the evolution of the engineering program into an impactful academic research powerhouse. “Susan and I continue to invest in the University of California, Irvine as an expression of our belief in it as a world-class research and educational institution – and in the invaluable role that public universities play in innovation,” said Henry Samueli, co-founder of the Samueli Foundation. “Engineers are hard-wired as problem solvers; we hope our new gift will allow them to focus their problem-solving skills on some of our world’s largest, most intractable issues.” Magnus Egerstedt, Stacey Nicholas Dean of Engineering for The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, said that UCI’s partnership with the Samuelis is highly collaborative, which is how the three themes of Engineering+ emerged. “The Samuelis care deeply about engineering education and health, so there is an elegant connection made between these two key interests through the Engineering+Health Institute,” Egerstedt said. “Strategically thinking, it also makes sense, because if you look at this part of the world – Orange County – the medical device and technology industry is very strong here. One can draw a direct line between what we do in our labs and the local industrial ecosystem that surrounds us.” The Engineering+Health Institute will house research into information technologies that bring medical care to underserved communities, synthetic biology to enable customizable disease treatments, and the combination of data science and biomedical device development. Efforts in these areas have gotten a head start, according to Egerstedt, through UCI’s tradition of bringing together engineers, biologists, medical researchers and others in focused, interdisciplinary research efforts. “The pathways already exist for us to do something major at the intersection of engineering and health,” he said. Researchers in the Engineering+Society Institute will investigate how automation can enhance the human experience. Intelligent transportation, AI, robotic co-workers and nonhuman caregivers will become the norm in the future, Egerstedt said. “I feel strongly that technology can serve as a beautiful force for good, but it’s up to us to make sure that our inventions don’t become invasive species,” he said. “Technology needs to work for us as a society, which means that engineers need to collaborate with experts in public policy, law and the humanities so that our work fits a broader societal context.” In his own academic history, Egerstedt merged robotics with climate and environmental monitoring, which has spurred his excitement about the formation of the Engineering+Environment Institute. Research into remote sensing of climate impacts, such as wildfires and beach erosion; data science for water modeling and management; and large-scale sustainable energy solutions are a few of the areas to be pursued in the institute. “Climate research is a historical strength of UCI; our researchers have won Nobel Prizes for answering climate-related questions,” Egerstedt said. “We have a strong presence in the relevant basic sciences on campus, and in the engineering school, we have leading experts in coastal engineering, hydrology and clean energy, for example. The Engineering+Environment Institute combines an extraordinarily important question with areas of strength on our campus.” But ultimately, the student experience must be front and center, Egerstedt said, and he considers the Office of Inreach to be the most important new initiative to be funded by the endowment. Close to 50 percent of UCI students are first-generation, the first in their families to attend college, and many are from historically underrepresented Hispanic, Native American, and Asian and Pacific Islander populations. The Office of Inreach combines cohort-based programs for students with a home away from home, including spaces for studying, building, socializing and networking. “We believe that Orange County can be a model place where well-being and opportunity for all is possible,” Samueli said. “That includes every student who enrolls at UCI. Establishing the Office of Inreach is a critical step toward ensuring that every student has what they need to thrive, succeed and, ultimately, graduate from UCI’s Henry Samueli School of Engineering.” In addition, the endowment created by this generous gift will fund research and teaching; workshops, speaker series and events; administrative staff and infrastructure; research grants and faculty retention; and graduate student fellowships, among other needs connected to the broader Engineering+ theme. “This support from Susan and Henry Samueli helps us move a massive step closer to becoming a destination for the smartest, most diverse, most passionate and most driven set of students and faculty on the planet,” Egerstedt said. “Through Engineering+, we can articulate what’s different about us and why UCI is a place where you can not only get a great education and launch a great career, but also make the world a little better while you’re at it.” About UCI’s Brilliant Future campaign: Publicly launched on Oct. 4, 2019, the Brilliant Future campaign aims to raise awareness and support for UCI. By engaging 75,000 alumni and garnering $2 billion in philanthropic investment, UCI seeks to reach new heights of excellence in student success, health and wellness, research and more.

What follows are their responses, in words and images, that span from conspiring with plants to off-the-grid hyper-local communities to a memento mori of nuclear catastrophe. Bert Winther-Tamaki , professor, art history Tonoshiki Tadashi, Yamaguchi-Nihonkai-Niinohama , Okonomiyaki . 1987. Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. Over a hundred local volunteers spent an entire day in 1987 gathering trash covering the Niinohama Beach in Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan and threw it into a large deep hole as part of a project by the environmental artist Tadashi Tonoshiki. Most of the trash was plastic washed ashore from the USSR, the Korean Peninsula, and China, and when the artist doused it with oil and set it on fire, the plastic melted and fused with soil from the sides of the hole. When cool, the two-ton agglomerate was hoisted out of the hole with a crane. With a wry sense of humor, Tonoshiki titled his trash sculpture Okonomiyaki , the name of a grilled fritter-like dish that is filled with variable ingredients and is especially popular in nearby Hiroshima. The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 when the artist was three years old killed his father immediately. His mother died of radiation sickness in 1950 and Tonoshiki himself suffered from radiation sickness as well, and would die a few years after creating Okonomiyaki . He said that burning and melting plastic trash gave him a sense of “confirming the unconscious memory of the scorched wasteland” he witnessed as a toddler. Following Tonoshiki’s wishes, the hulking carcass of plastiglomerate was left to weather and erode on the plaza of the Hiroshima City Contemporary Art Museum, but this fall we are going to transport it to the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and install it on the fifty-second floor in front of a glass wall with a spectacular view of the glittering metropolis. The long-range ballistic missiles fired periodically by North Korea over Japanese territory support the view that the Cold War never really ended in East Asia and now poses an increasingly ominous threat. Tonoshiki’s burnt plastic sculpture will serve as a memento mori warning against nuclear catastrophe that reduces the capital to a horrible wasteland like some enormous overcooked okonomiyaki. Bert Winther-Tamaki is guest curator of an exhibition opening at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo in October 2023. Jamie Nisbet , associate professor and chair, art history Living in Southern California, Earth Day each spring is a reminder of the connection between our local coastal environment and the ongoing struggle for its long-term sustainability. In the course of my own research on the history of California coastal practices and protections, I’ve been thinking recently about a bike ride that took place across the state in 1972 in support of a ballot initiative to create what is now the California Coastal Commission. The motivations for state representatives, everyday citizens, and even some children, to get on their bicycles that year are rooted in the same events that also spurred the complex combination of protests, teach-ins, and celebrations of the first Earth Day in 1970. Both arose in direct response to a disastrous oil spill that had taken place off the coast of Santa Barbara the preceding year. It garnered mass national media coverage and the mobilized local groups like Get Oil Out! Prior to the Santa Barbara spill and the outpouring of public support for environmental causes on Earth Day, state legislators had repeatedly been unsuccessful in their attempts to get past the influence of oil industry lobbyists in creating laws to protect against the development and privatization of California’s coastal areas. Like Earth Day taking its message to the streets, Proposition 20 was crafted in 1972 to take coast protections directly to California voters. By September of that year, however, it looked like the same old story would be repeating itself: being heavily out funded by the petrodollars backing “No on 20,” the proposition’s prospects were lagging. That’s when a few young legislative staffers had the idea to stage the ride, which got picked up by local media coverage, and even a few celebrities along the way. As a do-it-yourself response to helping pass the California Coastal Act—which it ultimately achieved—the 1972 ride is a helpful reminder of the power of homegrown initiatives. It also reminds us how much environmental imaginaries have shifted in the span of a few generations. For the dozens of cyclists, casting aside their cars, in protest of offshore drilling and urban development, there is no written record acknowledging the bicycles themselves as eco-friendly vehicles. The dominant petrochemical narrative has been inherited by our own era, and we continue to struggle against the forgetting of past moments when alternatives came into view. Lyle Massey , associate professor, art history and visual studies Off the grid | As homelessness increases and environmental stresses intensify in the United States (drought, water quality deterioration and rationing, landfill overflows, industrial hazards, air pollution, etc.), off-grid communities like Slab City near the Salton Sea will become models for habitation that defy urban norms. Residents of these communities will rely on solar and wind power and on shared bartering economies that stand outside of capitalist enterprises. They have their own libraries, bars and services. As macro-economic and political policies fail to address poverty or solve ecological problems such as climate change, temperature and sea-level increases, and rising demand for clean water and food resources, off-grid living will appear more and more attractive. Local communities will informally band together to solve immediate problems of energy and water access, becoming self-governing and less dependent on state and federal governmental assistance. Photo by Lyle Massey Many such communities already exist, particularly throughout the western US. Some are environmentally utopian in character (i.e. New Mexico’s Greater World Earthship Community), while others lean towards “prepper” (preparing for a breakdown in societal order and norms). But many also exhibit variations on do-it-yourself creativity, supporting musical groups, poetry and literature collectives, and multiple forms of visual art. As with Noah Purifoy’s Desert Museum in Joshua Tree, these informal townships are often filled with installations of sculptures and structures built from trash and junk, presenting a running commentary on a contemporary culture that prizes constant consumption and planned obsolescence, producing waste at a breathtakingly rapid rate. In striking and startling ways, these communities show us where we are likely headed. Judy Tzu-Chun Wu , associate dean, School of Humanities and director, Humanities Center and Center for Liberation, Anti-Racism, and Belonging How is environmental justice a feminist issue? | Last year, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Title IX, my co-authored biography of Patsy Takemoto Mink, Fierce and Fearless , was published by NYU Press. Mink was the first woman of color in Congress, first elected in 1964, and the namesake for Title IX, which mandates gender equity for schools receiving federal funding. Fewer people know, though, that in the late 1970s, she also served as assistant secretary of state under President Jimmy Carter for the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES). Mink’s commitment to environmental protection and gender equity raises the question: How can environmental justice be a feminist issue? As the head of OES, Mink’s purview literally encompassed the entire world. In fostering international agreements in the midst of the Cold War, Mink foregrounded a definition of environmentalism that included human welfare and human rights. As she explained in a speech to members of the Japanese American Citizens League in San Fernando Valley, “The whole concept of international environment . . . has been redefined…. Rather than presenting a ‘negative kind of concept of just preventing pollution,’ environment has been described as the total condition people find themselves in.” [i] In other words, environmentalism represented a way to advocate for human rights, conceptualized as “improving the quality of life, medical career, access to the benefits of technology.” [ii] These concerns regarding human welfare had economic, regional, and gendered impacts. In a speech given in Hawai‘i, Mink reminded her audience, “We know that at least one billion people still live in poverty or near poverty. Of the poor, women and children suffer the most.” [v] At another talk in Nairobi, Kenya, where Mink addressed the fifth meeting of the United Nations Environment Programme, she emphasized the importance of advancing “the human condition so that all peoples can share the bounty of the earth to enjoy good nutrition, safe water, and a healthful environment in which to live.” [vi] As we celebrate Earth Day 53 years after its founding, I think it is important to consider the vision of Mink, who recognized the disproportionate impact of environmental injustice on particular communities. Her understanding of environmentalism did not seek solely to “protect” the environment from human beings. Instead, she foregrounded how the environment could sustain human life and enable women, particularly those who are impoverished and from the Global South, to fully thrive. Jonathan Alexander , Chancellor’s Professor of English and Informatics and director, Humanities Core I can’t imagine what the world will look like 50 years from now, and I’m hesitating to prognosticate — or even express a hope — because I’m not likely at all to be here at that point in the future. In fact, I have written elsewhere about the need to “deny legacy,” to unhitch ourselves from a sense that our lives should exceed their natural lifespans and that our thoughts, ideas, and feelings should live on after us, influencing the world to come, and, at worst, dictating terms about what we believe is important to the future. Who are we to know what’s best for the future? Who are we to imagine that future when we have done so poorly imagining and building a survivable (much less sustainable) present? In fact, maybe insisting on having a legacy is the problem, substantially contributing to impoverishing our world and its future. We insist on bequeathing our ideas, our way of life, insuring that our children will live as we have lived, if not better. We pass on wealth, for instance, and in the process we prolong structures of inequality, unleveling the “playing field” for all. We codify our values of acquisition and accumulation in law, protecting the ability of the haves to have more as opposed to practicing forms of wealth and resource redistribution now that will help those already suffering from climate, political, and economic crises. So, instead of imagining a future, even a collective one, my instinct is to pull back, to make space for those who will actually inherit that future, for those who will live to see what 50 years from now will be like. To be sure, I’m here to help, but I don’t want to impose. More importantly, I’m here to listen. What do you want from your future? And how can I help you create the future that you will live to see? Jon Pitt , assistant professor, East Asian Studies I’m looking at the many yellow and purple flowers in bloom here in Southern California, and I’m struggling to imagine a “remade environment” fifty years in the future. Photo by Jon Pitt Something about the word “remake” suggests too clean a break. Something about the “make” in “remake” feels like it gives humans too much agency, as if “we” (who’s “we”?) could sculpt our environment differently, if only given the chance to try again. But whose future do we imagine when we imagine a future? How far do we stretch our “we”? The flowers I’m looking at (some deemed “invasive” and targeted with removal) remind me of Natasha Myers’ “ Ten (not-so-easy) steps for life in the Planthroposcene ,”where she extends Tim Choy’s figuration of a “conspiracy of breathers” to plants. Myers stretches her “we” to plant life and implores us to do the same. She calls for us humans to “learn not just how to collaborate, but also how to conspire with the plants , to breathe with them. Remember, they breathed us into being.” In fifty-years’ time, can we humans learn to better con-spire (breathe with) and conspire (work together) with plant life—by far the most abundant form of life on this planet—in ways that encourage mutual flourishing? Meyers reminds us that “what is good for plants is good for everyone else. Get on their side.” I choose to get on their side and imagine not a remade environment, but a world of remembering the fundamental codependence humans share with plant life. Fifty years is a long time for a human, but only the blink of an eye for some plants. A less-anthropocentric vision of the future finds humans collaborating with plant life on soil remediation, food stability, social/environment justice and land-back movements across the globe. An unruly, weedy future with deep roots and seeds spreading far and wide. [i] “Mink: Everybody ‘Counts’ in Politics,” Pacific Citizen, February 17, 1978, p. 1.

On display June 3 to Sept. 9 at 18881 Von Karman Ave. in Irvine, the show juxtaposes idyllic California landscapes with photos, newspaper clippings and other ephemera related to the destruction, commercialization or – occasionally – preservation of such scenery in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. As “uncultivated land was quickly being turned into groves, farmland and ranches, artists persisted in capturing expansive meadows and wide-open spaces,” notes guest curator Cassandra Coblentz. The exhibition, which runs from June 3 to Sept. 9, highlights the tension between development and conservation of California’s natural environment. The parched creek bed and stream in Franz A. Bischoff’s 1912 “Arroyo Seco Bridge,” for example, are now a concrete flood channel.\n\nSteve Zylius / UCI Other painters, working on commissions from railways promoting tourism, depicted pristine shorelines, despite the growing scarcity of such spots. The exhibition, which borrows its “Indefinitely Wild” label from a passage in Henry David Thoreau’s book Walden , features 25 paintings and six previously unseen-in-public watercolors from Langson IMCA’s Buck and Irvine Museum collections. The gallery is divided into five sections – mountains, trees, the coast, water and land. In each, the art on the walls is put into historical context by explanatory texts and glass cases holding everything from avocado brochures to certificates for oil company stock from 1900. In one area, for instance, an impressionist portrait of a solitary tent on a wild seaside bluff is paired with an archival photo in which a throng of similar tents dots Aliso Creek Beach. Elsewhere, artwork of majestic mountains and lush forests is contrasted with photographs of mining and logging operations. But an upside is also presented. The environmental toll of the Gold Rush helped spur John Muir to form the Sierra Club in 1892, the exhibition explains. And the devastation wrought by timber companies led President Abraham Lincoln to sign an 1864 bill to protect Yosemite Valley and the nearby Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. But the clash between development and preservation is unavoidable, Coblentz says. From 1849 to 1852, California’s population mushroomed from 100,000 to 255,000 – and by 1930, Los Angeles alone claimed more than 1 million residents, paving the way for a nature-altering network of aqueducts, dams and reservoirs. Thus, in the exhibition’s water section, the parched creek bed and tiny stream in Franz A. Bischoff’s 1912 “Arroyo Seco Bridge” are now a concrete flood channel, while Channel Pickering Townsley’s 1919 “Bend of the River” captures an extinct view of the San Gabriel River. Channel Pickering Townsley’s 1919 “Bend of the River” captures an extinct view of the San Gabriel River. \n\nSteve Zylius / UCI Nearby, Granville Redmond’s portrait of Los Angeles Harbor in 1906 hangs next to Alson Skinner Clark’s rarely seen “Pedro Miguel Locks,” a 1913 work depicting construction of the Panama Canal, a project that would eventually turn L.A. into a major international port. Coblentz, who normally curates contemporary art, hopes museum visitors will come away reflecting on the long-standing push-pull between conservation and growth. “That tension has always been part of California,” she says. “We often assume the state’s wild spaces will always be there, but that’s not the case. The goal of the exhibition is to offer a nuanced understanding of the persistent need for protection and care of our natural environment.” Full artwork credits: Detlef Sammann, Del Monte Forest , 1915, Oil on canvas, 40 x 50 in.

This spring, two more accolades have been added to her impressive resume – a historic scholarly award for her biography of Patsy Mink, the first woman of color elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and the first Asian American woman to serve in Congress, and an excellence in mentoring award for her ongoing mentorship of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. After immigrating to the U.S. from Taiwan at just six years old, Wu grew up helping her parents run a hamburger joint that served Chinese food on the side. She never could have imagined, flipping flapjacks and frying egg rolls, that she would be enacting lasting institutional changes mere decades later. Shedding light on untold stories Wu, alongside her co-author Gwendolyn Mink, was awarded the 2023 Organization of American Historians (OAH) Mary Nickliss Prize in U.S. Women’s and/or Gender History for their book, Fierce and Fearless : Patsy Takemoto Mink, First Woman of Color in Congress (New York University Press, 2022). The award is intended to honor and pay tribute to the generations of women whose opportunities were limited by the historical context of their time. The winning biography is that of the renowned Asian American congresswoman, Patsy Takemoto Mink. Written in collaboration with Mink’s daughter, a political scientist and former UC Santa Cruz professor, Fierce and Fearless provides the first biography of the political groundbreaker who championed the passing of Title IX. Like Mink, Wu is no stranger to breaking boundaries and paving the way for those who follow her. Dr. Erika Lee, the former president of OAH, recognizes Wu and Mink’s historic win for their “pathbreaking” book, announcing, “Since the award's inception in 2015, Judy and Gwendolyn are the first Asian Americans to win the Mary Nickliss Prize, and Fierce and Fearless is the first Nickliss prizewinner that examines an Asian American.” Learning she and Mink were the first Asian American authors to win the award makes the award “even more meaningful” for Wu. When Wu and Mink began writing Patsy Mink’s biography, which Patsy had requested her daughter to do, they met with opposition from a publisher who wanted only an outsider perspective on Mink’s life. The two disagreed, believing in true Patsy Mink fashion that it was essential to have this feminist collaboration in authorship. “So, winning the award feels like a vindication in our choice to partner with one another, and the prize also gives additional attention to Patsy Mink, who has tended to be overlooked in both scholarship and popular memory.” Centering student voices Where Patsy Mink forever paved the way for generations of girls and women, one of the hallmarks of Wu’s academic journey has been her unwavering dedication to student mentorship. It’s no surprise then that she received this year’s Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS) Excellence in Mentorship Award, which recognizes those who have exhibited exceptional mentorship to students and/or colleagues. Despite the number of administrative obligations and engagements vying for her attention, Wu has remained faithful in her mission to guide students and coordinate opportunities to engage in community-based research. To Wu, mentorship is a must. “Students are why we have a university,” she says. “In fact, their insights can help illuminate new pathways for our collective endeavors.” Stephanie Narrow, a history Ph.D. student at UCI, recalls her latest work with Wu as a graduate student researcher providing administrative support for an upcoming anthology. To Narrow’s surprise, Wu and her co-authors invited Narrow to join them as a fellow co-editor, sharing in their royalties. Wu brought her in “not as a student, but as an equal,” Narrow says. “Judy does not merely make room at the table for her students and colleagues; she finds the largest room with the biggest table so that everyone might have a seat.” A seat that Christian Okubo, a former UCI undergraduate and current doctoral student in the history and Asian American studies departments, has been privy to since he was an undergraduate. The effect Wu had on Okubo was so profound, he candidly shared that despite applying to a number of esteemed institutions, his choice school was UCI. Why? “If I was to become a Ph.D. student,” Okubo states, “my goal was for it to be specifically under Dr. Wu’s mentorship.” Wu has long been a champion of mentorship at all levels of the academic system – high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, colleagues and community members. Fourth-year UCI undergraduate Rehana Morita, an Asian American studies and film and media studies double major, credits Wu’s mentorship as the catalyst for a long path in community-based work. After leaving an internship prematurely due to a lack of support, Wu affirmed Morita in this decision, encouraging her to pursue programs that better supported and aligned with Morita’s academic interests. “She is the first professor who made me feel like I was not lacking in any knowledge or skill as a person,” Morita, a first-generation student, shares. “She helped me value my lived experiences and what I learned in my upbringing as important contributions to any classroom or professional setting. Most importantly, she taught me how to advocate for myself.” The paths forward Phuc To, a UCI alumna currently pursuing a doctoral degree at UCSD, found Wu’s mentorship to be particularly helpful as a first-gen international student navigating the educational system on her own. “Dr. Wu’s mentorship made me feel seen, cared for and empowered,” says To. To further support students like Morita and To, along with the other first-generation students who constitute approximately half of the students in the School of Humanities and at UCI, Wu is developing a first-gen communications program that will engage undergraduates with faculty. Though not first-generation herself, as an immigrant, a person of color and a woman, Wu knows how it feels to be an outsider and hopes she can foster an environment to help these students succeed. As Wu reflects on her achievements, there is still much work to be done. “I hope, as I help to transform the School of Humanities and UCI through my work in directing the Humanities Center and the newly created Center for Liberation, Anti-Racism and Belonging, that I can open pathways for others so that they can find a sense of home and the inspiration and support to fully thrive.” Asian American Studies First Gen History Humanities Center Related News Lunar New Year 2023 A guide on the holiday and its global celebrations James Kyung-Jin Lee honored with prestigious book award UCI Asian American studies professor authored medical humanities book UCI launches Center for Liberation, Anti-Racism and Belonging C-LAB to foster research related to race, Indigeneity and migration Growing from grassroots UCI community members fund endowments to support Asian American studies UCI Podcast: Patsy Mink’s role in Title IX passage Co-authors of Mink’s biography share history of law designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex See the humanities in action Subscribe 4000 Humanities Gateway Irvine, CA 92697 facebook youtube twitter instagram linkedIn Get in touch 949.824.6117 humanities@uci.edu humanities.uci.edu Useful links Contact Us University of California, Irvine SOH Portal Office of Undergradute Study Facilities Office of Graduate Study Accessibility/Copyright Unit 18 Workload Policy UCI Humanities' COVID-19 Resource Website Copyright © 2023 UC Regents.

Both were scholars in the Cal-Bridge program which creates pathways for underserved students to pursue advanced degrees through one of nine University of California campuses. \n\nUCI Katy Rodriguez Wimberly and Manuel Paul pursued their doctorates in physics and astronomy at UCI and are now both fulfilling their promise as they begin new positions as faculty members at California institutions of higher education. Uniting them is their status as Cal-Bridge scholars. Cal-Bridge is a higher education program that provides a pathway for students from historically underrepresented populations to move up from the California State University system to a University of California institution to pursue advanced degrees in physics and astronomy. Rodriguez Wimberly has accepted a tenure-track position in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at California State University, San Bernardino, starting in the fall. Paul has been offered a tenure-track faculty position at Cosumnes River College, a community college in Sacramento, where he will start teaching physics and astronomy courses in August. Cal-Bridge serves students at 116 California community colleges, all 23 CSU campuses and nine UC locations. It was designed to open doors to educational opportunities to women people of color to help diversify the state’s science, technology, engineering and math professoriate and workforce. Launched in 2014, Cal-Bridge supports students through their Ph.D. studies at UCs by providing funding for tuition and research projects, professional development and guidance from mentors. An Army veteran, Rodriguez Wimberly became a Cal-Bridge scholar in 2015 as a student at California State University, Long Beach. She was accepted into the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program and earned a Ph.D. in astrophysics at UCI in 2021 before becoming a NSF MSP-Ascend postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at UC Riverside. As a professor at CSUSB, Rodriguez Wimberly will remain part of the Cal-Bridge program as a faculty mentor to physics and astronomy students at the university. She will also join the Cal-Bridge leadership team as statewide director of the mentorship program. “Cal-Bridge was crucial for me not only in preparing for graduate school but creating and expanding my network of amazing and caring scientists; many of my astrophysics research collaborators I’ve connected with through Cal-Bridge,” says Rodriguez Wimberly. “My network and the support they give me has enabled me to create the career of my dreams, which is doing excellent astrophysics research, contributing to an equitable and inclusive STEM community through mentorship work and research and staying in Southern California with my family.” Originally from San Bernardino County, Paul went to CSUSB, as an undergraduate majoring in applied physics. He went on to UCI to pursue his Ph.D. and was awarded an NSF GRFP fellowship in his first year. Paul will also continue with Cal-Bridge, recruiting students at his new campus to apply to the program as they transfer to a CSU to complete their four-year bachelor’s degree. “The Cal-Bridge network has benefitted me tremendously by connecting me with an advisor who supported and encouraged me. I would have never applied to graduate school without that support,” Paul says. Kevork Abazajian, UCI professor of physics & astronomy, is the leader of Cal-Bridge at UCI, which is the longest-serving and top UC institution in terms of accepting Cal-Bridge scholars. He is also co-director of the organization’s physics and astronomy operation statewide. “Katy Rodriguez Wimberly and Manuel Paul are perfect examples of the personal success that students from underrepresented communities can achieve through Cal-Bridge,” Abazajian says. “With the help provided by initial funding by the NSF and more recent financial support through the State of California, we hope to continue the growth and prosperity of the program.” If you want to learn more about supporting this or other activities at UCI, please visit the Brilliant Future website .

This Engineering+ expansion is made possible by a $50 million gift from Susan and Henry Samueli. Steve Zylius / UCI Irvine, Calif., June 5, 2023 — The creation of three new multidisciplinary research institutes in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering is being made possible by a $50 million gift from Susan and Henry Samueli to the University of California, Irvine. Unified under the banner “Engineering+,” the Engineering+Health Institute, Engineering+Society Institute and Engineering+Environment Institute will allow researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct transformational research addressing the most important issues facing humanity today. In addition, a portion of the gift will be used to create the Office of Inreach, dedicated to the well-being, academic success, sense of belonging and career opportunities for undergraduate students in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. “The enduring generosity of Henry and Susan Samueli has enabled University of California, Irvine researchers to seek answers to the most challenging questions and make breakthroughs that impact all our lives,” said UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman. “The investments the Samuelis have made in UCI over nearly a quarter century – bridging engineering, health, interdisciplinary research and student success – have paid substantial dividends in our institution, our community and the world.” Susan and Henry Samueli have made the largest gifts to UCI in the university’s history, including a $200 million donation to create the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences; $30 million to fund the construction of the Samueli Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building; a $20 million naming gift to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering; and the most recent $50 million to support the establishment of three Engineering+ institutes to address challenges in health, society and the environment. Steve Zylius / UCI Susan and Henry Samueli have made the largest gifts to UCI in the institution’s history. In 2017, they pledged $200 million to create the Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. A $30 million gift from the Samueli Foundation funded the construction of the Samueli Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building. In 1999, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering received a $20 million naming gift that, in part, endowed 10 chairs and professorships and funded two scholarships and a graduate fellowship. This donation was critical to the trajectory of the engineering school, which has grown significantly in both scope and size since the turn of the millennium: Faculty increased from 105 members in 1999 to 162 in 2023; the undergraduate population jumped from about 1,600 to over 3,500; and the graduate student body more than tripled from about 300 to over 1,050. These changes highlight the transformational nature of the gift, as it enabled the evolution of the engineering program into an impactful academic research powerhouse. “Susan and I continue to invest in the University of California, Irvine as an expression of our belief in it as a world-class research and educational institution – and in the invaluable role that public universities play in innovation,” said Henry Samueli, co-founder of the Samueli Foundation. “Engineers are hard-wired as problem solvers; we hope our new gift will allow them to focus their problem-solving skills on some of our world’s largest, most intractable issues.” Magnus Egerstedt, Stacey Nicholas Dean of Engineering for The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, said that UCI’s partnership with the Samuelis is highly collaborative, which is how the three themes of Engineering+ emerged. “The Samuelis care deeply about engineering education and health, so there is an elegant connection made between these two key interests through the Engineering+Health Institute,” Egerstedt said. “Strategically thinking, it also makes sense, because if you look at this part of the world – Orange County – the medical device and technology industry is very strong here. One can draw a direct line between what we do in our labs and the local industrial ecosystem that surrounds us.” The Engineering+Health Institute will house research into information technologies that bring medical care to underserved communities, synthetic biology to enable customizable disease treatments, and the combination of data science and biomedical device development. Efforts in these areas have gotten a head start, according to Egerstedt, through UCI’s tradition of bringing together engineers, biologists, medical researchers and others in focused, interdisciplinary research efforts. “The pathways already exist for us to do something major at the intersection of engineering and health,” he said. Researchers in the Engineering+Society Institute will investigate how automation can enhance the human experience. Intelligent transportation, AI, robotic co-workers and nonhuman caregivers will become the norm in the future, Egerstedt said. “I feel strongly that technology can serve as a beautiful force for good, but it’s up to us to make sure that our inventions don’t become invasive species,” he said. “Technology needs to work for us as a society, which means that engineers need to collaborate with experts in public policy, law and the humanities so that our work fits a broader societal context.” In his own academic history, Egerstedt merged robotics with climate and environmental monitoring, which has spurred his excitement about the formation of the Engineering+Environment Institute. Research into remote sensing of climate impacts, such as wildfires and beach erosion; data science for water modeling and management; and large-scale sustainable energy solutions are a few of the areas to be pursued in the institute. “Climate research is a historical strength of UCI; our researchers have won Nobel Prizes for answering climate-related questions,” Egerstedt said. “We have a strong presence in the relevant basic sciences on campus, and in the engineering school, we have leading experts in coastal engineering, hydrology and clean energy, for example. The Engineering+Environment Institute combines an extraordinarily important question with areas of strength on our campus.” But ultimately, the student experience must be front and center, Egerstedt said, and he considers the Office of Inreach to be the most important new initiative to be funded by the endowment. Close to 50 percent of UCI students are first-generation, the first in their families to attend college, and many are from historically underrepresented Hispanic, Native American, and Asian and Pacific Islander populations. The Office of Inreach combines cohort-based programs for students with a home away from home, including spaces for studying, building, socializing and networking. “We believe that Orange County can be a model place where well-being and opportunity for all is possible,” Samueli said. “That includes every student who enrolls at UCI. Establishing the Office of Inreach is a critical step toward ensuring that every student has what they need to thrive, succeed and, ultimately, graduate from UCI’s Henry Samueli School of Engineering.” In addition, the endowment created by this generous gift will fund research and teaching; workshops, speaker series and events; administrative staff and infrastructure; research grants and faculty retention; and graduate student fellowships, among other needs connected to the broader Engineering+ theme. “This support from Susan and Henry Samueli helps us move a massive step closer to becoming a destination for the smartest, most diverse, most passionate and most driven set of students and faculty on the planet,” Egerstedt said. “Through Engineering+, we can articulate what’s different about us and why UCI is a place where you can not only get a great education and launch a great career, but also make the world a little better while you’re at it.” About UCI’s Brilliant Future campaign: Publicly launched on Oct. 4, 2019, the Brilliant Future campaign aims to raise awareness and support for UCI.

This disparity raises concerns that many individuals with dementia are not receiving the specialized care they need and questions the implications for their quality of life and health outcomes,” says Dana Mukamel, corresponding author and UCI professor of medicine.\n\n\nUCI School of Medicine Irvine, Calif., June 6, 2023 — The quality of care for nursing home residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias is best when they are in the majority, but most facilities also accommodate a heterogeneous population, where specialized staff training is limited, according to a study led by the University of California, Irvine. “Recognizing and managing the complex medical conditions and behavioral symptoms of residents with ADRD require enhanced knowledge among staff. These findings raise significant concerns regarding the level of care and quality of life for the majority of these people, highlighting the urgent need for a higher level of care for them,” said Dana Mukamel, corresponding author and UCI professor of medicine. Findings, recently published in the June issue of the journal Health Affairs , are based on an analysis of 13,909 facilities between 2017 – 2019. Data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services were analyzed to assess facilities with high and low ADRD populations, staffing levels, quality of care and health outcomes for 7.6 million residents, 42 percent of whom were diagnosed with ADRD or cognitive impairment. Researchers discovered that ADRD residents were dispersed throughout all nursing homes, with fewer than half in facilities where they accounted for 60-90 percent of the population. It was also revealed that fewer than 5 percent of nursing home beds are in dementia special care units, and only facilities that had an ADRD population exceeding 90 percent seemed to offer better care. “This study aimed to address the gaps in the current literature regarding the concentration of ADRD residents in nursing homes, and the implications that has on their quality of care,” Mukamel said. “Our findings highlight the need for specialized training and raise important policy issues that must be addressed.” The National Alzheimer’s Project Act of 2011 has prompted increased investment in research by the National Institute on Aging, and federal policies to improve nursing home care through enhanced staffing standards are expected to benefit all residents. However, the lack of training based on population mix raises concerns about ensuring quality and safety for those with ADRD. “While the prevalence of ADRD is expected to grow in coming decades, those residing in nursing homes represent the majority in only a few facilities,” Mukamel said. “Efforts to inform optimal care practices, staffing requirements and training require investments in research, policy and innovation. Continued focus and collaboration are essential to drive progress and improve the care, quality of life and health outcomes for this vulnerable population.” The team also included researchers Deborah Saliba, UCLA Anna & Harry Borun Endowed Chair in Geriatrics and Gerontology, and associate director for education in the Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare System; Heather Ladd, UCI general internal medicine research senior statistician and data analyst; and Tamara Konetzka, the Louis Block Professor of Public Health Sciences at the University of Chicago.

Recently published online in the journal JAMA Network Open , the findings revealed a substantial reduction in the number of binge drinking episodes within the last 28 days among those who had used the AB-CASI health tool compared to the standard care group. While both study groups experienced some decrease in alcohol use after one month, the AB-CASI group showed significant and sustained reductions at the 12-month mark. “This tool offers considerable promise in addressing alcohol-related health disparities and should be considered for routine emergency department screening and intervention, as we know that incremental sustained reductions in alcohol use can benefit both individual and public health,” Vaca said. The research team also included doctors and healthcare professionals from the Yale School of Medicine, the Yale School of Public Health and the University of Texas at El Paso.

Emergency Preparedness at UCI Emergency Preparedness at UCI What could go wrong? When an emergency occurs or a disaster strikes, UCI seeks to maintain a safe and secure campus for all students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Campus preparedness is more than preparing for emergencies. The primary goal is to create an environment that's safe and secure every day. In times of disasters, colleges and universities serve as key emergency management partners to federal, state, local, tribal, territory and private sector organizations. Institutions are encouraged to regularly review, update, and exercise their emergency plans. Colleges and universities are encouraged to review, update, and exercise their emergency plans several times per year.

As a UC Irvine student, you have access to resources that extend across our campus, throughout our state, and beyond. This Catalogue will serve as an invaluable guide to enhancing your UCI experience. UCI is consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities. Achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, medicine, and management have garnered top 50 national rankings for more than 40 academic programs. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes—two in chemistry and one in physics. We were the youngest campus ever to be welcomed into the prestigious Association of American Universities. The New York Times , in its College Access Index, ranked UCI as number one in the nation for economic diversity in its student body, citing us as \"doing the most for the American dream.\" And you will be especially glad to hear that Money magazine named UCI the top university for beach lovers. These are some of the reasons why UCI attracted more than 133,000 undergraduate applications in 2020, the fourth largest number of applications in the entire nation. Our graduate programs are also extremely competitive. You are on this campus because we know you have what it takes to succeed at the highest level. UCI reaches beyond the classroom and laboratory to help solve societal issues and support human development. We are a hub for stem cell research, a trailblazer in understanding global warming, and a leader in the fight against breast cancer. Our nationally ranked medical center in Orange, home of the only National Institutes of Health-designated comprehensive cancer center in Orange County, serves as Orange County’s only Level I trauma center, and our state-of-the-art UC Irvine Douglas Hospital has been ranked among the country’s top 50 hospitals for more than 14 years, providing outstanding care for the region’s citizens. The Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences is the first university-based health sciences enterprise to incorporate integrative health research, teaching, and patient care across its schools and programs, including medicine, nursing, pharmaceutical sciences, and public health. Our law school, the state’s first public law school to open in more than 40 years, graduated its first class in 2012. A major intellectual and cultural center, UCI offers numerous public activities and events. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the School of Humanities produce engaging and entertaining cultural programs, including the award-winning New Swan Theater, our summertime outdoor Shakespeare Festival. UCI’s Anteater athletes have won more than two dozen national championships. We are also national leaders in research and practice relating to sustainability and environmental protection. UCI is the most energy-efficient campus in California, with among the most LEED Platinum and Gold certified buildings in the U.S. We are consistently among the top 10 “Coolest Schools” in Sierra magazine’s annual ranking of the nation’s greenest universities. UCI is benefiting the community and the world in countless ways through its scholarly, scientific, creative, and economic contributions. Orange County’s second largest employer, UCI generates an annual economic impact on the county of $7 billion. I encourage you to take advantage of all that UCI has to offer. I look forward to seeing you on campus and to being a part of this very important time in your life.

Academic Integrity Policy THE MANUAL OF THE IRVINE DIVISION OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE PART III - APPENDICES OF THE IRVINE DIVISION Appendix VIII: UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Integrity Revised: 12/12/96, 10/12/00, 11/21/02, 1/21/03, 1/26/06, 4/05/07, 6/7/2007, 6/5/08, 4/23/15 I.  Preamble The University of California, Irvine is an institution of learning, research, and scholarship that is strengthened by the existence of an environment of integrity. As members of the academic community, instructors, students, and administrators are responsible for maintaining this environment. It is essential that all members of the University practice academic integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work and actions. Violating the Academic Integrity Policy is unacceptable, devaluing the teaching and learning experience for the entire community. While at UCI, members of the academic community should become better educated about the ethical framework underpinning academic integrity and improve their moral standards supporting it . The UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Integrity states the general rules and procedures associated with student academic integrity. This Academic Integrity Policy applies to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a UCI course. A separate policy governs the integrity of research. Medical students are governed by policies specified in the UCI School of Medicine Handbook . Law students are governed by policies specified in School of Law Academic Honor Code . II. Defined Terms Academic Integrity Policy: the UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Integrity. Academic Integrity Policy Violations: outlined in the Procedures document of the Academic Integrity Policy. Academic Consequences: grades assigned by Instructor. Administrative Sanctions: outlined in the Procedures document of the Academic Integrity Policy. AIAO: Academic Integrity Administrative Office. Instructor: faculty member or instructor of record. Student: any student or students who have allegedly violated the Academic Integrity Policy. Hearing Panel: subcommittee of the Council of Student Experience as outlined in the Procedures document of the Academic Integrity Policy. III. Students' Responsibilities All students are expected to complete a course in compliance with the Instructor's standards. No student shall engage in any activity involving any Academic Integrity Policy Violations. No student shall engage in any activity that involves attempting to receive a grade by means other than honest effort, and shall not aid another student who is attempting to do so. All students are encouraged to notify instructors, but may also notify the AIAO, about observed incidents of Academic Integrity Policy Violations. Instructors should take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of students making such reports. All students have the responsibility to become familiar with and abide by the Academic Integrity Policy. IV. Instructors’ Responsibilities Instructors should create an environment in their classes where academic integrity is understood and supported. They should assign grades in a transparent and equitable manner. Specifically: When an Instructor believes that a Student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the Instructor should report the incident to the AIAO within thirty instructional days of discovering the possible Academic Integrity Policy Violation. The Instructor shall participate in the process according to the Academic Integrity Policy. In all cases, the Instructor shall determine the Student’s grade in the course. V. Teaching Assistant’s (TA) and Reader’s Responsibilities A student acting in the capacity of a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Reader has a special responsibility to safeguard academic integrity. A TA/Reader shall equitably grade student work in the manner set by the Instructor. A TA/Reader shall not provide a student with any information or collaboration that would aid the student in completing the course in a dishonest manner (e.g. providing access to unauthorized material related to tests, examinations, or homework). When a TA/Reader has evidence of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, the TA/Reader should report the incident to the Instructor. The Instructor should report the incident to the AIAO. VI. Responsibility for Resolution of Cases of Violation of the Policy The responsibility for maintaining the standards of academic integrity rests with two University authorities: the Instructor and the AIAO. Under the Standing Orders of the Regents, discipline is the exclusive responsibility of the campus administration while authority over courses and curricula is under the exclusive authority of the Instructor through the Academic Senate. A. Role of the Instructor The Instructor shall assign grades in the course as appropriate to the work involved. All Academic consequences (e.g. scores on the assignments and course grades) are under the sole purview of the Instructor in the course. B. Role of The AIAO The AIAO manages the cases for all students accused of Academic Integrity Policy Violations and is the central repository for all case-related materials. The AIAO is the initial contact for the Instructor or students on all cases of Academic Integrity Policy Violations. The AIAO is also responsible for imposing administrative sanctions. These sanctions shall be in accordance with guidelines authorized by the Council on Student Experience. Administrative sanctions range in severity from administrative probation to dismissal from the University. Students found responsible for multiple cases of Academic Integrity Policy Violations may be subject to dismissal from the University. The AIAO must notify the Student (and if needed, the Instructor) of any allegations of Academic Integrity Policy Violations. The AIAO adjudicates cases when the Student disputes the possible imposition of administrative sanctions related to Academic Integrity Policy Violations. The AIAO can request meetings with the Instructor and Student to discuss the case, sanction, or procedure. The AIAO must follow the procedures and communicate in a timely manner. He or she may extend any timelines in the Academic Integrity Policy when practical exigencies so dictate, in which case all involved parties will be notified in writing and via email. If the Student appeals the AIAO's decision, the AIAO shall schedule a Hearing Panel (see below) to review the case and make a final determination of the appropriate sanction. The duty of the AIAO is not merely disciplinary. The office is encouraged to work with faculty and students to create a culture in which academic integrity is valued. C. Records Management The AIAO must archive its records to reflect the resolution of the case, and shall maintain a record of all cases as described in the Procedures document. The AIAO shall report annually to the Academic Senate Council on Student Experience, to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Associated Undergraduate Students of the University of California, Irvine, and the Associated Graduate Students of the University of California, Irvine on all of the following: (1) the number, nature, and type of cases; (2) the pattern of decision-making; (3) the severity and type of academic consequences and administrative sanctions; and (4) other relevant matters as directed by the Council on Student Experience. D. Role of the Hearing Panel If the Student requests a hearing, the AIAO will request the Subcommittee on Academic Integrity of the Council on Student Experience to convene a Hearing Panel to review the case. (See the Procedures document.) The Hearing Panel will hear evidence on the case from the Student, Instructor, and other relevant parties as determined by the panel. The Hearing Panel shall communicate the final decision to the AIAO. VII. Procedures for Resolution of Cases of Academic Integrity Policy Violations These are described in the Procedures document of the Policy. VIII. MAINTENANCE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS The AIAO will maintain a record of each student who receives a letter(s) of Academic Integrity Policy Violations as described in the Procedures document. Maintaining such a record is not an administrative sanction. Academic Integrity Procedures PROCEDURES FOR RESOLUTION OF CASES OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY VIOLATIONS I.    Overview The procedure for resolution of Academic Integrity Policy Violations is divided into four phases: The Reporting Phase. During this phase, the Instructor or a student communicates to the AIAO about any alleged Academic Integrity Policy Violation; The Review Phase. During this phase, the Student is afforded the opportunity to review the charges. The AIAO reviews the evidence in consultation with the various parties and decides responsibility. The Decision Phase. During this phase, the AIAO decides on the Administrative Sanctions and communicates the decision to the various parties; and The Hearing Phase. During this phase, if the Student chooses to contest the sanctions, a Hearing Panel will be convened to review the case and make a final decision. The four phases are described in more detail below. II.  The Reporting Phase When an Instructor has evidence that a Student has committed an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, the Instructor should meet with the Student to discuss the alleged Academic Integrity Policy Violation. If the Instructor suspects that there is evidence of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, he or she should submit a formal charge describing the alleged Academic Integrity Policy Violation to the AIAO and the AIAO will send a copy of the charge to the Student. All cases of alleged Academic Integrity Policy Violations should be reported to the AIAO. Within thirty (30) instructional days of the confirmation of evidence of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, the Instructor should notify the AIAO of the case by submitting through an online form the following information:  the Student’s name, the Student’s ID, the course name and number, the date of the incident, and a description of the incident. If, after reporting a charge to the AIAO, the Instructor decides to withdraw the charge, the Instructor shall notify the AIAO via email of his or her decision. The AIAO shall notify the Student and the appropriate Associate Dean (if necessary) that the Instructor has withdrawn the charge against the Student. All notation of the charge shall be removed from the Student’s academic record. Should new evidence become available, the charge may be reinstated in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policy. In all cases, the Instructor shall determine the grade for the assignment and for the course. If a student reports an incident of a violation of academic integrity to the AIAO, the AIAO shall communicate the allegation to all involved parties. III. The Review Phase Once the Instructor or student has reported a charge of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation to the AIAO, the AIAO shall notify the Student in writing and via email that the Student is charged with an Academic Integrity Policy Violation. The official notice shall be sent to the Student’s UCI email address. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Integrity should be included in the notice. The letter may include a notification to the student to schedule a meeting with the AIAO to discuss the case. The student will have ten (10) instructional days to schedule the meeting to review the case. If the student does not schedule or fails to attend a scheduled meeting, the AIAO will move forward with determining a policy violation and will impose sanctions without the students input. If the Student schedules a review, the AIAO shall review the charge(s) with the Student and may advise the student regarding possible administrative sanctions and the process for resolution of the charge(s) of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation. The AIAO will conduct the review by collecting the relevant documents, including the facts of the charge and the Student’s description of the disagreement with the facts of the charge. The AIAO can request meetings with the Instructor and Student to discuss the case, the sanctions, or the procedures. The AIAO decides, based on the preponderance of the evidence, whether there was an Academic Integrity Policy Violation justifying administrative sanctions. IV. The Decision Phase If the Student is found responsible for an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, administrative sanctions shall be determined by the AIAO. Administrative sanctions can range from administrative probation to dismissal from the University, depending on the severity of the case, any previously recorded offenses, and any mitigating circumstances. In such cases, these sanctions, as described below, will be administered by the AIAO. In the decision letter, the student will be notified of the hearing process and will be provided with a link to the procedures. The AIAO shall notify the Instructor and the appropriate Associate Dean(s) of the administrative sanction(s). A record of the administrative sanction(s) shall be maintained by the AIAO. The AIAO shall notify the Student of the decision. V. The Hearing Phase Once the AIAO has issued a decision and sanctions, the Student may contest the decision and/or sanctions within ten instructional days of receiving notification by the AIAO, by requesting an Academic Integrity Hearing Panel. The Student may request a hearing by submitting a written appeal to the AIAO. The AIAO will forward the appeal to the Academic Integrity Review Board (AIRB), which will schedule a hearing of the case before the Hearing Panel. The hearing will be scheduled as soon as possible, but no later than sixty (60) instructional days after the Student requests a hearing. VI. Hearing Panel on Academic Integrity The AIRB will hear undergraduate and graduate student cases. The AIRB will be a standing senate committee comprised of fourteen senate faculty members, three Associate Deans representing undergraduate student education, and three Associate Deans representing graduate student education. VII. Hearings If the Student requests a hearing, the AIRB shall schedule a hearing of the case. The student will be afforded two options. Option A: (for outcomes of warning, probation and educational sanctions) A student contests in writing within ten (10) instructional days to request a hearing; The student contests outcome(s) based on three criteria a. New evidence which could not be adduced earlier which is likely to change the results; b. Violation of due process; or c. An imposed sanction that is too harsh given the findings of fact. 3. The student is not present; hearing panel reviews all written information; 4. The hearing panel will convene and review the written request, and all materials that were utilized in the original finding of responsibility; 5. The hearing panel will complete review and may affirm, modify, or reverse original sanction; 6. Decision is final and communicated to AIAO to notify student. Option B: (for outcomes of suspension and dismissal) A student contests decision in writing within ten (10) instructional days to request a hearing; The request is to hear the case from the beginning; The student is present; The student will have the opportunity to present to the hearing panel, have an advisor *; The AIAO will present all relevant information to the hearing panel; The hearing panel will determine a finding and sanctions, if appropriate; they may affirm, modify or reverse original sanction Decision is final and communicated to AIAO to notify student. •    Students are allowed to have an advisor. An advisor can be an attorney, parent, friend, etc. During the hearing, an advisor may act as a consultant for the student; however, an advisor may not speak on behalf of the student. If a student chooses to have an attorney as the advisor, the student shall pay all fees, costs, and expenses for the retention of an attorney. If the student chooses to be accompanied by an advisor or attorney during the hearing, the student must sign a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974  (FERPA) waiver, to grant access to the information. In the interest of expediency, as a general practice, hearings shall not be delayed due to the unavailability of an advisor/attorney. Once the hearing is scheduled, the AIRB must provide written notice to the parties involved regarding the date, time, and place of the hearing. The AIRB will rule on all questions of procedure, the admission or exclusion of evidence, and the need to call witnesses for additional testimony. Hearings shall be held in accordance with generally accepted standards of procedural due process. Hearings will be closed. Reasonable efforts will be made by all parties to preserve confidentiality during the process. The Chancellor shall establish and publish campus regulations providing for the handling of academic integrity cases in accordance with basic standards of procedural due process. Authority may be delegated to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs as outlined in Section 11.00 Authority of the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations and, Students ( http://ucop.edu/student-affairs/policies/student-life-policies/pacaos.html ). Consistent with this requirement, procedures specified in such regulations shall be appropriate to the nature of the case and the severity of the potential discipline. When a formal hearing is held, the following minimum procedural standards will ensure the accused student a fair hearing: Written notice within a reasonable time before the hearing. The written notice shall include the following information: (1) a brief statement of the factual basis of the charges; (2) the University policies or campus regulations allegedly violated; and (3) the time and place of the hearing. The opportunity for a prompt and fair hearing where the University shall bear the burden of proof, and at which the student shall have the opportunity to present documents and witnesses, to contest evidence, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses presented by the University. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no inference shall be drawn from the silence of the accused student. A record of the hearing and an expeditious written decision based upon the preponderance of evidence, which shall be accompanied by a written summary of the findings of fact. VIII. Report of the AIRB Hearing Panel on Academic Integrity Hearing Panel After the hearing, the Hearing Panel shall arrive at a final decision. When a decision is reached, the AIAO will be informed of the decision. There are no further appeals or processes. IX. IMPLEMENTATION Once the decision has been rendered, the AIAO will notify the Student by issuing a letter to the Student and initiate any other necessary administrative actions. In case of a change in sanctions, the AIAO shall notify the Instructor and the appropriate Associate Dean(s) of the new administrative sanction(s). A record of the administrative sanction(s) shall be maintained by the AIAO. Students found in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy must complete an online tutorial reviewing the Academic Integrity Policy. Students must complete this before they can enroll for courses during the year following the incident or, in the case of seniors, before a degree is awarded. When, as a result of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy, a student is suspended or dismissed, a notation that the discipline was imposed must be posted on the academic transcript for the duration of the suspension or dismissal. If a student receives a reduced grade in a course because of an Academic Integrity Policy Violation, the reduced grade will remain on the transcript even if the student retakes the course and obtains an improved grade. Students with Academic Integrity Policy Violations may be excluded by the Associate Deans from consideration for academic honors at graduation.  For students who wish to change majors, individual majors may take into account the commission of an act of dishonesty.  Exclusions from consideration for honors and exclusion from major change are not determined at the time of the violation and do not fall under this Policy. Thus, students so affected are not eligible to request a formal hearing on the exclusion. X. MAINTENANCE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS The AIAO will maintain a record of each student who receives letter(s) of Academic Integrity Policy Violations and produce annual reports. The AIAO is required to report annually to the Academic Senate Council on Teaching, Learning, and Student Experience (CTLSE), the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Associated Undergraduate Students of the University of California, Irvine, and the Associated Graduate Students of the University of California, Irvine, as outlined in Section VI.C. of the Academic Integrity Policy. Records will normally be destroyed after seven years, unless the AIAO determines in any particular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. To ensure that minor (refers to anything below a suspension) and nonrecurring infractions do not hurt a student's career beyond UCI, the AIAO will expunge academic records upon reward of degree. The University will release a student's disciplinary records to potential employers, governmental agencies, other educational institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law. Any record expunged by the AIAO will also be expunged in the offices of the appropriate Associate Deans. XI. TYPES OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY VIOLATIONS Academic integrity applies equally to electronic media and print, and involves text, images, and ideas. Violations include but are not limited to the following examples: A. Cheating Copying from others during an examination. Communicating examination answers to other students during an examination, or communicating examination questions to students who will take the same examination later. Offering another person's work as one's own. Taking an examination for another student. Asking or allowing a student to take an examination for oneself or another student. Sharing or collaborating on answers for a take-home examination or assignment unless specifically authorized by the instructor. Tampering with an examination after it has been graded, and then returning it in an attempt to earn more credit. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes, or other information concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. B. Dishonest Conduct Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. Falsifying or forging academic documents or records. C. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words, images, or other creative works of another. To use a creative production without crediting the source, even if only minimal information is available to identify it for citation. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summarizing a work (in whole, or in part), and for information which is not common knowledge. D. Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student perform any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to discipline under the Academic Integrity Policy. Examples of collusion include: Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Allowing another student to copy one's own work during a test or take-home assignment. XII. GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS FOR POLICY VIOLATIONS When a student is found to have violated University policies or campus regulations, any of the following disciplinary actions may be imposed. Any sanction imposed should be appropriate to the violation, taking into consideration the context and seriousness of the violation. A. Educational Course A tutorial or course which the student will be required to take. B. Warning Written notice or reprimand to the student that a violation of specified University policies or campus regulations has occurred, and that continued or repeated violations of University policies or campus regulations may be cause for further disciplinary action, normally in the form of disciplinary probation, loss of privileges and exclusion from activities, suspension, dismissal, or any combination of the preceding disciplinary actions. C. Disciplinary Probation Disciplinary probation is a status imposed for a specified period of time during which a student must demonstrate conduct that conforms to University standards of conduct. Conditions restricting the student's privileges or eligibility for activities may be imposed. Violation of any conditions of the probation or the policy may result in further disciplinary action, normally in the form of suspension or dismissal. D. Suspension Suspension is termination of student status at the campus for a specified period of time with reinstatement thereafter certain, provided that the student has complied with all conditions  imposed as part of the suspension and provided that the student otherwise qualifies for  reinstatement. Violation of the conditions of suspension or of University policies or campus regulations during the period of suspension may be cause for further disciplinary action, normally in the form of dismissal. E. Dismissal Dismissal is termination of student status for an indefinite period. Readmission to the University shall require the specific approval of the Chancellor of the campus to which a dismissed student has applied. Readmission after dismissal may be granted only under exceptional circumstances. F. Revoking Awarding of Degree Subject to the concurrence of the Academic Senate, a student’s degree may be revoked if obtained by fraud. Such revocation is subject to review on appeal by the Chancellor. G. Other Other disciplinary actions may include community service. Principles of Community UCI is a multicultural community of people from diverse backgrounds. Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multi­cultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California constitutions and from the charter of the University of California, which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the protection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchallenged within the university. Tolerance, civility and mutual respect for diversity of background, gender, ethnicity, race and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Education and a clear, rational and vigorous challenge are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The university’s nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in university programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of university nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Information concerning these policies is available at the University of California Office of the President . Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on university property or in connection with official university functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with university policy. All who work, live, study and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the university community can successfully conduct its affairs. Click here to visit the Rights of Free Speech and Academic Freedom website. Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the university are expected to conduct themselves as responsible members of the academic community and in a manner compatible with the university’s function as an educational institution. The University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations and Students set forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. The Policies lists rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the President of the University, and incorporates campus regulations. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and welfare of the individuals involved. In February 2006, the Education Code of the State of California was repealed and amended to codify within the Penal Code a new definition of hazing. In accordance with the revised Education Code and Penal Code, students are advised of the following: Penal Code 245.6 Section 245.6 of the Penal Code reads: It shall be unlawful to engage in hazing, as defined in this section. “Hazing” means any method of initiation or preinitiation into a student organization or student body, whether or not the organization or body is officially recognized by an educational institution, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury to any former, current or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution in this state. The term “hazing” does not include customary athletic events or school-sanctioned events. A violation of this section that does not result in serious bodily injury is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. Any person who personally engages in hazing that results in death or serious bodily injury as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (f) of Section 243 of the Penal Code, is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison. The person against whom the hazing is directed may commence a civil action for injury or damages. The action may be brought against any participants in the hazing, or any organization to which the student is seeking membership whose agents, directors, trustees, managers or officers authorized, requested, commanded, participated in or ratified the hazing. Prosecution under this section shall not prohibit prosecution under any other provision of law. Campus Safety and Security The UCI Police Department is responsible for the safety and security of the UCI campus and the UC Irvine Health Medical Center campus. Safety and security at UCI and UC Irvine Health is a collaborative effort. UCI Police Department strives to foster a secure and supportive environment at UCI and UC Irvine Health. Crime Prevention The UCI Police Department offers many educational programs and presentations to the campus community. The UCI Police Department teaches a variety of prevention and awareness topics. These topics include workplace violence and active shooter, drug and alcohol abuse prevention education, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking awareness and prevention programs, identity theft, property and auto theft, and personal safety. For more information or to schedule a presentation, call 949-824-5223 or visit the UCI P ublic Safety website . Crime prevention tips are also available on the website. In addition, the UCI Police Department maintains a Daily Crime and Fire Log for both the UCI and UC Irvine Health Medical Center campuses which contains a record of all crime reported to the UCI Police Department that occurred on or near UCI and the UC Irvine Health Medical Center for the most recent 60 day period. The Daily Crime and Fire Logs are open to the public at the front desk of the UCI Police Department administrative lobby during normal business hours (generally Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.). For more information, visit the Crime and Fire Log . Safety Tips All members of the UCI community should be aware of their surroundings. Theft is the most common crime on the UCI campus. In order to help prevent theft, personal belongings (e.g. backpack, laptop computer, cellular phone) should be kept in sight, within arm’s length or secured in a locked place. Students living on the UCI campus should keep their doors and windows locked at all times. Faculty and staff should keep valuables locked up while they are in their workplace. The last person to leave a laboratory or building should lock the doors before they leave. Report the presence of suspicious activity to the UCI Police Department as soon as possible by dialing 949-824-5223. While on the UCI campus at night, it is suggested that you do not walk alone. The UCI Safety Escort Program is a free service available to all members of the UCI community. Safety escorts are also available at the UC Irvine Health Medical Center. Safety escorts will offer immediate (or as soon as possible) or pre-arranged safety escorts. Safety escorts on the UCI campus may be requested for free by dialing 949-824-7233 (SAFE) and on the UC Irvine Medical Center campus by dialing 714-456-5493. For more information, visit the UCI Police Department's Safety Escort page . Emergency Call Boxes (Blue Light Phones) Blue Light emergency call boxes are located throughout the UCI campus and the UC Irvine Health Medical Center campus. These call boxes are to be used to report emergencies, crimes, suspicious persons or activities, accidents, and safety hazards. The UCI campus has over 150 Blue Light emergency phones installed around the ring mall, housing communities, and in parking structures and parking lots. Blue Light emergency phones are represented by a diamond on the UCI campus map . Blue Light call boxes are easily identified by the blue light on top of the terminal and the boxes have the ability to detect all sounds within a 15-foot radius. In order to activate the emergency call box, push the red button located on the front of the terminal. This will automatically connect the blue light phone to the UCI Police Department Dispatch Center. The UC Irvine Health Medical Center has emergency call boxes located throughout the complex and in the southeast corner of the Manchester parking lot. These call boxes are also connected to the UC Irvine Police Department Dispatch Center. Emergency Procedures and zotALERT Emergency Notification The Emergency Management Division is charged with helping to continuously improve the resilience and readiness of the UCI campus community to respond to and recover from natural and human caused emergencies through mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Emergency preparedness and evacuation information is provided to ensure the UCI community is prepared to respond in the event of a campus emergency. The UCI emergency procedures, preparedness, and evacuation information is available on the E mergency Management website zotALERT is an emergency alert system that uses cell phone text messaging and UCI email to quickly notify the UCI community when a significant emergency or dangerous situation is confirmed, which poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of the UCI campus community. The zotALERT system is also available to members of the UC Irvine Health Medical Center community. Students are strongly encouraged to sign up for zotALERT messages. A “text-enabled” mobile phone is needed. In order to sign up: Login to StudentAccess Click “Contact Information” Enter your mobile phone number Click the “submit changes” button Timely Warning (Crime Alert) Notifications In order to help safeguard the UCI and UC Irvine Health Medical Center campus communities and to increase crime awareness, a Crime Alert may be issued following the timely report of a Clery Act reportable crime to the UCI Police Department where the reported crime is considered by the UCI Police Department to represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. Crime Alerts are used to alert the entire community about certain crimes in a manner that aids in the prevention of similar crimes and to allow people to take precautions for their personal safety. The determination to issue a Crime Alert is made on a case-by-case basis in light of all of the facts surrounding a reported crime. Each Crime Alert is sent community-wide at UCI and/or UC Irvine Health Medical Center via the Zot Mail email system. Community Advisory Notifications The UCI Police Department may issue a Community Advisory notification for reported incidents that do not rise to the level of a zotALERT or Crime Alert notification. A community advisory notification may be issued for a specific segments of the campus population and may be sent to certain school and/or department head personnel for notification to their respective populations, as deemed necessary on a case-by-case basis. Community advisories may be distributed via electronic or physical distribution methods. Substance Abuse Policies UCI is designated a drug-free environment. The sale, manufacture, distribution, or possession of any illegal controlled substance is a violation of both state and federal laws and will be strictly enforced by UCI Police Department. The consumption of alcohol is allowed only under certain conditions in compliance with state law. All members of the UCI community who violate substance abuse laws are subject to disciplinary action, criminal prosecution, fines, and/or imprisonment. The sale, consumption, and furnishing of alcohol on the UCI campus is restricted by UCI’s Alcohol Policy and California State law. These laws are controlled by the California Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control (ABC). ABC and UCI Police Department share the enforcement responsibility of alcohol laws on the UCI campus. It is unlawful to sell, furnish, or give alcohol to a person under the age of 21 years old (including at the Anthill Pub & Grille on the UCI campus). The possession of alcohol by anyone under 21 years old in a public place, or in a place open to the public, is also illegal. Additionally, it is also a violation of UCI’s Alcohol Policy for anyone under the age of 21 to consume or possess alcohol in any public or private housing area on campus. Students and employees found violating alcohol/substance policies or laws could be subject to disciplinary sanctions by UCI. Weapons Policy The California Penal Code contains several sections regarding the possession or control of weapons on college campuses. The UCI Police Department encourages all members of the campus community to be familiar with the following statutes that regulate the possession or control of weapons: Penal Code Section 626.9 – Felony Violation – Bringing or possessing a firearm on the grounds of a University of California campus, or any property owned or operated by the University of California, without written permission from the UCPD Chief of Police. Penal Code Section 626.10(b) – Misdemeanor or Felony Violation – Bringing or possessing any dirk, dagger, ice pick, or knife having a fixed blade longer than 2 ½ inches on university grounds. Penal Code Section 16590 – Misdemeanor or Felony Violation – Possessing an undetectable firearm, cane gun, wallet gun, zip gun, belt buckle knife, blackjack, billy club, nunchaku, shuriken, metal knuckles and other prohibited weapons. Penal Code Section 21510 – Misdemeanor Violation – Carry upon the person, or in the passenger or driver’s area of a vehicle, a switch blade knife having a blade longer than 2 ½ inches in length.

Annual Disclosure Notification - Clery Act Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report The UCI Police Department publishes and makes available to all current and prospective students, staff, and faculty the UCI and UC Irvine Health Medical Center Annual Security Report and UCI Annual Fire Safety Report pursuant to the federal Clery Act . Both of these annual reports may be directly accessed at: UCI and UCI Health Annual Security Report UCI Annual Fire Safety Report The Annual Security Report, coordinated by the UCI Police Department, includes information about crime prevention and reporting; emergency response and evacuation; emergency notifications; timely warnings; alcohol, drug, and weapon policies; security and safety policy information; sexual violence prevention; and other topics. This report also includes statistics for the past three calendar years for crimes that occurred at the UCI and UC Irvine Health Medical Center campuses; in certain off-campus buildings or property; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from each campus. The Annual Fire Safety Report, coordinated by UCI Environmental Health & Safety department, includes information on fire safety policies and fire safety systems as well as statistics for the past three calendar years for fires that occurred in UCI on-campus student housing facilities. Paper copies of these reports are available upon request by calling the UCI Police Department at 949-824-1885 or at 100 Public Services Building at UCI during normal business hours. Computer- and Network-Use Policy The University of California, Irvine provides computing resources and worldwide network access to members of the UCI electronic community for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate, access knowledge, and retrieve and disseminate information. All members of the UCI community (faculty, staff, students, and authorized guests) sharing these resources also share the rights and responsibilities for their use. Rights and Responsibilities Worldwide, open-access electronic communication is a privilege and continued access requires that users act responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from violation, destruction, theft, or other abuse. Users sharing computing resources must respect and value the rights and privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Users are responsible for refraining from acts that waste resources, prevent others from using them, harm resources or information, or abuse other people. To help protect files, users are responsible for setting passwords appropriately and for keeping passwords confidential by not giving them to another person. Most UCI-owned computers are under the control of a system administrator or lab manager. These administrators are expected to respect the privacy of computer system users. However, UCI computer system administrators may access user files or suspend services on the systems they manage without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use, misuse, or have been corrupted or damaged. This includes temporarily locking vulnerable accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource intensive jobs, and such. Many UCI departments have their own computing and networking resources and policies. When accessing computing resources, users are responsible for obeying both the policies described here and the policies of other departments. Student responsibilities are also described in the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students . In addition, all users are responsible for obeying policies of off-campus network services accessed using UCI resources. Examples of Misuse Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to: Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended solely for the purpose of damaging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bots, flash programs, or password cracking programs. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent of the system administrator. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data. Using computers or electronic mail to act abusively toward others or to provoke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of violence, or other hostile or intimidating “fighting words.” Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize or stigmatize individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, and other protected characteristics. Posting on electronic bulletin boards or Web pages materials that violate the University’s codes of conduct (faculty, student). This includes posting information that is slanderous or defamatory in nature or displaying graphically disturbing or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that are in view of other individuals. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user’s electronic communications or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user’s files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Using campus networks to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to any computer system. Using a computer account or obtaining a password without appropriate authorization. Facilitating or allowing use of a computer account and/or password by an unauthorized person. Employing, either directly or by implication, a false identity when using an account or other electronic resources. This includes sending unauthorized mail that appears to come from someone else. Performing an act without authorization that will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, networks, or will interfere with others’ ability to make use of the resources. Using an account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to work at UCI, such as consulting services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commercial enterprises for personal financial gain. Deliberately wasting computing resources, such as playing games (for example, MUDS or IRC) while someone else is waiting to use the computer for UCI-related work, sending chain letters, spamming, treating printers like copy machines, storing or moving large files that could compromise system integrity or preclude other users’ right of access to disk storage, and the like. Consequences of Misuse Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privileges and/or Federal or State legal prosecution. Appropriate corrective action or discipline may be taken in conformance with applicable personnel policies, student policies, collective bargaining agreements, and procedures established by the Academic Senate. California Penal Code, Section 502 makes certain computer abuses a crime, (such as illegal reproduction of software protected by U. S. copyright law) and penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment. Files may be subject to search under proper authorization. Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, overloading systems, excessive disk space consumption, are typically handled internally to the department in an informal manner. More serious infractions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to circumvent system security, and the like are handled formally through the Office of the Dean of Students or by other appropriate officials. Contact Information For additional information, contact the Office of Information Technology by calling 949-824-2222, or by sending email to oit@uci.edu . OIT Help Desk offices are located in Administrative Module B, Building 423 - parking lot 16. Privacy and Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records —that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students—include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. At UCI, an “applicant” becomes a “student” at the time of submission of their Statement of Intent to Register form. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and procedures implementing these laws which protect the student’s right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: To inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students. To seek correction of the student’s records through a request to amend the record that the student believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights. To have withheld from public disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. To grieve an alleged violation of privacy rights, as specified in the University student records policies. To file complaints with the University Registrar or with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded by the federal act. Students should view the Privacy section on the University Registrar’s website for more information on how to exercise these rights. There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose information. The University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students , Part B, Section 130.721 contains a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: student’s name photo date and place of birth telephone numbers campus email address dates of attendance major field of study grade level number of course units in which enrolled enrollment status, (e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time, or part-time) degrees and honors received most recent previous educational institution attended participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the University Registrar for instructions on how to do so. If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student’s name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student’s name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student’s name and dates of attendance, a student’s status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers with out the written consent of the student. Further, if a student’s last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. It is extremely important for each student to keep the University Registrar currently informed as personal data changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University’s student records policies and FERPA. Copies of the FERPA and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Langson Library. In addition, University policies are published in the University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by FERPA may be filed with the University Registrar. A complaint must be made within 180 days of when the alleged violation was discovered (not necessarily when the alleged violation may have occurred). Additionally, a student may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office . Types and locations of major student records maintained by the campus are listed in the following table; consult the UCI website , or the Campus Directory, or building directories for room numbers.

Inquiries may be addressed to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions University of California, Irvine Irvine, CA 92697 http://www.admissions.uci.edu The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday; telephone 949-824-6703 . Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who is currently in high school or has graduated from high school but has not enrolled in a regular session (fall, winter, spring) at a college or university. A transfer applicant is a student who has enrolled in a regular session (fall, winter, or spring) at a college or university after high school. (Students who meet this definition cannot disregard their college records and apply as freshmen. A student who attends a college summer program immediately after graduating from high school or who has completed college work while in high school is still considered a freshman applicant.) A California Community College applicant is one who completed at least 30 semester (45 quarter) UC-transferable units at one or more California Community Colleges. The last college the student attended in a regular session (fall/spring or fall/winter/spring) before admission to a UC campus must be a California Community College. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Supplemental Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly registered and enrolled at UCI and who has interrupted the completion of one or more quarters of enrollment. See Readmission: Undergraduate and Graduate Students. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who wishes to obtain a second bachelor’s degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident. A limited status applicant - frequently known as a non-degree-seeking student - is held to the same restrictions as applicants pursuing a second B.A. or B.S. degree. Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of California is guided by the University’s commitment to serve the people of California and the world, from every culture and ethnicity and across the economic spectrum. The University’s admission requirements, described in detail in the Minimum Admission Requirements for Freshmen section, are designed to ensure that students are adequately prepared for University-level work. Meeting admission requirements entitles an applicant to be considered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. In recent years, the number of freshman applicants to UCI has exceeded the number of spaces available. Since the campus cannot admit all eligible applicants, it must use standards that are more demanding than the minimum UC requirements to select students. These standards, which the University calls selection criteria, are used to identify applicants who have demonstrated the highest academic achievement and who have a variety of other qualities that can contribute to the strength and diversity of the campus community. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified applicants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit an Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major to the academic counseling office in the school or program of their prospective major. Admissions Selection Due to COVID-19, be sure to visit admissions.uci.edu for the most up-to-date information regarding undergraduate admission requirements. UCI seeks to select students who have a demonstrated record of academic and personal achievement. Academic achievement includes the number of college preparatory courses completed; the level of achievement in these courses, including honors, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and college courses completed; and the quality of the senior-year program as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Also considered are the high school grade point average (GPA) calculated on UC-specified subjects (UCI uses a maximum of eight honors grade points in determining the UC GPA). The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. Personal achievement outside of the classroom is also considered in UCI's selection process. A range of pursuits is considered, including academic activities, the creative and performing arts, community service and leadership, athletics, participation in pre-collegiate programs that develop academic ability, and other extracurricular activities. Persistence counts more than scattered involvement, while initiative and curiosity are also important. The admissions process at UCI is also sensitive to individual circumstances and the effect these may have had on the resources available to and the experiences of applicants. While all applications receive careful consideration, reviewers take note of any extenuating circumstances and/or a variety of cultural and economic situations, including students who are the first in their families to attend college, who have a low family income, or who have worked in support of their family during high school. The emphasis, however, is less on the personal circumstances of the applicant and instead is more focused on how the applicant has responded to challenges while achieving academic success. Every attempt is made to become familiar with the unique accomplishments of each applicant. Students interested in the majors below should be aware of the following provisions. Dance and Music: Dance applicants must audition in late January/early February in ballet, modern, and jazz, prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated, and be selected by faculty. All Music applicants must apply to the B.A. program and audition in late January/early February with an instrument or voice, prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated; admission to the B.Mus. program is by a second audition after matriculation. Computer Science and Engineering (offered jointly by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering) : Applicants must complete four years of high school mathematics through pre-calculus or math analysis and are advised to have completed one year each of chemistry and physics. One semester of programming coursework is also advised. (This requirement does not apply to other majors offered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.) That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is fundamental to success in the program. Nursing Science: Admission to the Nursing Science major is limited and selective. Applicants must complete two years of basic science providing fundamental knowledge in the core disciplines of biology and chemistry. Advanced laboratory science classes that have biology or chemistry as prerequisites and offer substantial additional material may be used to fulfill this requirement. Students must earn grades of C or higher in order to fulfill their subject requirements. Admission Requirements for Freshmen Due to COVID-19, be sure to visit admissions.uci.edu for the most up-to-date information regarding undergraduate admission requirements. The requirements described below represent the minimum academic standards students must attain to be considered for admission to the University. Meeting minimum admission requirements does not guarantee admission. Admission to UCI and the program of choice often requires students meet more demanding standards. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Subject Requirement To satisfy the subject requirement, students must complete a minimum of 15 yearlong (or 30 semester) UC-approved college preparatory courses with a letter grade of C or better, with at least 11 (22 semester) of the courses finished prior to the beginning of their last year of high school. These courses are also known as the A-G courses. A grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better must be earned (3.4 if the student is a nonresident) in these courses with no grade lower than a C. The 15 required A-G courses are: A. History: Two years of history, including one year of world or European history, cultures and geography (may be a single yearlong course or two one-semester courses); and one year of U.S. history or one-half year of U.S. history and one-half year of civics or American government. B. English: Four years of college-preparatory English that include frequent writing, from brainstorming to final paper, as well as reading of classic and modern literature. No more than one year of ESL-type courses can be used to meet this requirement. C. Mathematics: Three years of college-preparatory mathematics that include the topics covered in elementary and advanced algebra and two- and three-dimensional geometry. A geometry course or an integrated math course with a sufficient amount of geometry content must be completed.  Approved integrated math courses may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement, as may math courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades if the high school accepts them as equivalent to its own courses. D. Science: Two years of college-preparatory science, including or integrating topics that provide fundamental knowledge in two of these three subjects: biology, chemistry, or physics. One year of approved interdisciplinary or earth and space sciences coursework can meet one year of the requirement. Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Science courses can be used in area D as an additional science (i.e., third year and beyond). E. Language Other Than English: Two years, or equivalent to the second level of high school instruction, of the same language other than English are required. (Three years/third level of high school instruction recommended.) Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, composition, and culture. American Sign Language and classical languages, such as Latin and Greek, are acceptable. Courses taken in the seventh and eighth grades may be used to fulfill part or all of this requirement if the high school accepts them as equivalent to its own courses. (Students are strongly encouraged to complete three or four years of one language in preparation for the UCI Language Other Than English and/or the International/Global Issues general education requirements.) F. Visual and Performing Arts: One yearlong course of visual and performing arts chosen from the following disciplines: dance, drama/theater, music, interdisciplinary arts or visual art -- or two one-semester courses from the same discipline is also acceptable. G. College Preparatory Elective: One year (two semesters), in addition to those required in \"A-F\" above, chosen from the following areas: visual and performing arts, history, social science, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science and language other than English (a third year in the language used for the “E” requirement or two years of another language). Courses Satisfying the “G” Requirement History : All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political history or economic history) and should provide an understanding of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student’s critical thinking, ability to evaluate historical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. Social Science : Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objectives should include as many of the following as are applicable to the field: (1) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cultures; (2) to examine the historic and contemporary ideas that have shaped the world; (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function; (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior; and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student’s critical thinking, ability to evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence in the laboratory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet state-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational character are not acceptable social science electives. English : All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in creative writing, journalism, speech or debate is acceptable if it meets the general requirements in reading and writing stated above. An advanced-level course in English as a Second Language (ESL) or English Language Development (ELD) may be acceptable provided it meets the standards outlined under the “B” requirement. Advanced Mathematics : Acceptable electives are courses in mathematics with second-year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, precalculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, and probability and statistics. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elective if it fulfills the following objectives. The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard computer language such as C++, Pascal, Java, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course, each student should complete substantial programming projects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Science : Acceptable courses should cover topics from the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. An introductory science course normally offered in the ninth grade, (such as earth science or physical science) is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamental principles of physical and/or biological science. Laboratory activities as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Language Other Than English : It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the language other than English “E” subject requirement. Elective courses in this language must have at least two years of the language as a prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Visual and Performing Arts : Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theater, music, interdisciplinary arts or visual art. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artistic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with discrimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to artistic performance and developing creative artistic ability should have prerequisites (either one year of introductory coursework or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the introductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for example, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, research projects and/or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily athletic or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. College Preparatory Elective : The general objectives of the “G” requirement are to improve students’ analytical abilities, promote artistic development, and strengthen oral and written skills. The requirement is intended to encourage prospective University students to fill out their high school programs with courses that: (1) strengthen general study skills, particularly analytical reading, expository writing and oral communication; (2) provide an opportunity to begin work that could lead directly into a major program of study at the University; (3) experience, at some depth, new areas of academic disciplines that might form the basis for future major or minor studies at the University. Courses that fulfill the “G” requirement should allow students to prepare for college-level work in the subject area, so that the level attained at the end of such courses would be well beyond the introductory or survey level. Courses that have narrow objectives aimed at meeting specific societal or personal lifestyle goals are not acceptable. California High School Students. Courses taken to fulfill the subject requirement must be certified by the University as meeting the requirement and must be included on the UC-certified course list of the school the student attended. The high school counselor or principal will have a copy of this list. In addition, the lists are available at the A-G course list site . Out-of-State High School Students. The UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants graduating from out-of-state schools. Exam Requirement UCI will not consider SAT or ACT scores for admission or scholarship purposes. After enrollment, exams may be used for class placement or some graduation requirements. IMPORTANT: SAT Subject Tests have been discontinued. Scholarship Requirement In order to be considered for admission, applicants must have earned a minimum GPA of 3.0 (3.4 for nonresidents) in all A-G courses completed in grades 10 and 11, with no grade lower than a C. We award extra grade points for grades received in approved honors-level courses to a maximum of eight semesters, including no more than four semesters taken in the 10th grade. California Students State residents who qualify for admission requirements by one of the following paths and are not admitted to a campus they apply to will be offered admission at another campus if space is available. Statewide path: Students must rank in the top 9 percent of California students, according to the UC admissions index. Local path (ELC): Students must rank in the top 9 percent of their own high school graduating class. Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) To qualify for Eligibility in the Local Context, an applicant must be a California resident and attend a participating California high school. To be considered for ELC, an applicant must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and complete the following A-G courses prior to their senior year: History: 1 year English: 2 years Mathematics: 2 years Science: 1 year Language Other Than English: 1 year Other A-G courses (chosen from the subjects listed above or another course approved by the University): 4 years Admission By Exam In general, this method of consideration is designed for students who have been unable to meet the regular subject requirements and/or earn a high school diploma because of unique circumstances, such as non-traditional education or long-term illness. To be considered, a student must take either the ACT or the SAT, as well as two SAT Subject Tests, and earn a minimum UC Score calculated from their exam scores. Students may not use an SAT Subject Test to meet this requirement if they have completed a transferable college course with a grade of C or better in that subject. Students who qualify by examination are not guaranteed admission. However, they are entitled to a full review of their application. For more information, visit UC Admission by Exam website . Nonresident Freshman Admission Requirements Due to COVID-19, be sure to visit admissions.uci.edu for the most up-to-date information regarding undergraduate admission requirements. Nonresident freshman applicants must meet the same admission requirements as those for California-resident students, except , nonresident applicants must have a minimum 3.4 GPA in the 15 college preparatory courses (A-G), with no grade lower than a C. Refer to the Expenses, Tuition, and Fees section of this Catalogue for information regarding residence classification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Supplemental Tuition. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who enrolled in a regular session (fall, winter, or spring) at a college or university after high school. (Summer sessions do not count.) UCI considers a California Community College transfer applicant as a student who has completed at least 30 semester units/45 quarter UC transferable units at one or more California Community Colleges and the last college attended in a regular session (fall/spring or fall/winter/spring) before admission to UCI is a California Community College. A competitive UCI transfer applicant should have a UC transferable GPA of 3.0 or above. All majors at UCI are selective and applicants are encouraged to earn the highest possible GPA. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Transfer Admission Requirements.) Transfer Admission Guarantee: UCI’s Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) program offers provisional admission to well-qualified junior-level students from participating California Community Colleges. While all majors at UCI are selective, through TAG, admission to participating TAG majors can be guaranteed for transfer students who meet the TAG eligibility and major prerequisites requirements. (see TAG Requirements later in this section). Selection Criteria Due to COVID-19, be sure to visit admissions.uci.edu for the most-up-to-date information regarding undergraduate admission requirements. UCI attempts to accommodate as many qualified transfer applicants as possible. Priority consideration for admission of transfer applicants is given to junior-level applicants (with a minimum of 60 semester/90 quarter units of UC transferable credit) from California Community Colleges and is based upon: GPA in transferable courses; depth of preparation toward general education and major requirements; and participation in the TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee) program, which requires early completion of one transferable English composition course and one transferable course in mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning. TAG Applicants for fall quarter 2022 admission must have completed the first English and one mathematics course by the end of summer 2021. The second English course must be completed by spring 2022. Transfer applicants with the strongest academic performance will be the most competitive for admission. Junior transfers from four-year colleges, including other UC campuses, and lower-division transfers will be considered as space permits. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified applicants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit an Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major to the academic counseling office in the school or program of their prospective major. This is of particular importance to those who apply in majors which are subject to additional course prerequisites and/or have a limit placed on the number of applicants admitted into the major. (See the following list.) UCI’s transfer selection process is also based upon consideration of the academic criteria in conjunction with the following personal achievement criteria: an exceptionally challenging curriculum; outstanding accomplishments relevant to academic aims; hardships or unusual circumstances the applicant has faced, and the ways in which the student has responded to these challenges; a strong, thoughtful match between UCI’s programs and the student’s academic and career objectives, preparation, talents, and skills; and potential contributions to the campus. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. Transfer applicants to the following majors must complete prerequisite courses for the major as specified. Biological Sciences: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Biological Sciences major. All applicants must complete one year of general chemistry with laboratory with grades of C or better; one year of organic chemistry with laboratory with grades of C or better; one year of biology courses equivalent to BIO SCI 93 , BIO SCI 94 at UCI with a grade of C or better in each course; and have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Biology/Education: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Biology/Education major. All applicants must complete one year of general chemistry with laboratory with grades of C or better; one year of organic chemistry with laboratory with grades of C or better; one year of biology courses equivalent to BIO SCI 93 , BIO SCI 94 at UCI with a grade of C or better in each course; and have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Business Administration: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall (minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0) and who satisfactorily complete lower-division courses equivalent to UCI’s calculus ( MATH 2A - MATH 2B ), economics ( ECON 20A - ECON 20B or MGMT 4A - MGMT 4B ), and statistics and accounting ( MGMT 7 , MGMT 30A - MGMT 30B ) will be given preference for admission. MGMT 1 may be completed at UCI. Admission to the major will be competitive due to limited space availability. Business Information Management: Junior-level applicants who satisfactorily complete the following requirements will be given preference for admission: One year of approved college-level math, preferably courses in calculus equivalent to UCI’s MATH 2A - MATH 2B ; if not available, two semester courses equivalent to other major-related math courses are acceptable; Completion of one year of transferable computer science courses involving concepts such as those found in Java, Python, C++, data structures, or other object-oriented or high-level programming language. One year of introductory accounting theory and practice equivalent to UCI’s MGMT 30A - MGMT 30B and One year of micro- and macro-economics theory equivalent to UCI’s ECON 20A - ECON 20B .

Students, however, cannot earn units or grade points in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of IB credit, even if placement results require enrollment in such a level. The units granted for IB examinations are not counted toward the maximum number of credits required for formal declaration of an undergraduate major or the maximum number of units a student may accumulate prior to graduation from the University. Students who enter the University with IB credit do not have to declare a major earlier than other students nor are they required to graduate earlier. Application Procedures Students may apply to UCI using the online application at the University of California Admissions website . Applications must be submitted by the last day of the admission application filing period. The nonrefundable application fee is $70 ($80 for international students). When to Apply for Admission To ensure that applications will be considered for admission to UCI and the student’s choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be submitted during the admission application filing period, November 1–30, 2021, for fall quarter 2022. UCI accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. After the admission application filing period has ended, UCI will accept applications only if openings remain for new students. Academic Record. On the application, students must report all high schools and colleges attended, regardless of credit earned or courses completed. All courses taken must also be reported, regardless of grades earned. This includes reporting courses repeated with both the original and repeated grade. Failure to submit an accurate academic record will result in any admissions offer being rescinded. Transcripts The UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student’s academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. Transcripts and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Freshman Applicants. Freshman applicants should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UCI, an official final high school transcript showing an official graduation date must be forwarded to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions even if a student attends summer session. Final official transcripts are due in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by July 1 for those students admitted for fall quarter. [A California Certificate of Proficiency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a General Educational Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma.] Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the academic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. Transfer Applicants. Transfer applicants should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. It is essential that applicants accurately complete the self-reported college credit information in the application because it will be used for initial admission screening. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UCI, an official transcript from each college attended and the high school from which they graduated must be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions even if a student attends summer session. Final official transcripts are due in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by July 1 for those students admitted for the fall quarter. Summer-session transcripts must be submitted by September 15. Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the academic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. Notification of Admission Most fall quarter freshman applicants are notified of their admission status between February 1 and March 31. Transfer applicants are usually notified by May 1. In some cases for transfer applicants, complete transcripts of coursework and/or a mid-term progress report are required before a final decision can be made; such records will be requested by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall admission application filing period, November 1–30. Those students who apply after the admission application filing period will be notified as soon as possible after the other applicants. Statement of Intent to Register Students who are offered admission and wish to attend UCI must return a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR). The SIR serves to notify UCI of the student’s decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before completing and returning their SIR, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their response to each campus. However, it is essential that students allow enough time to meet the stipulated deadline. Once they have decided which UC campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonrefundable $250 deposit (if applicable) either electronically or by mail. (This deposit, known as the Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, is applied to the Student Services Fee when the student enrolls.) Low-income students may have the deposit postponed (deferred) until financial aid is disbursed to cover tuition and fees. Students must submit their SIR by the following deadline: Freshmen entering fall 2022: May 1, 2022 Transfers entering fall 2022: June 1, 2022 Electronic Filing: Students are encouraged to return their SIR electronically. Log in to the UCI Applicant Portal . Students submitting an SIR electronically are required to pay their $250 deposit (if requested) by credit card. Filing by Mail: Students who are unable to submit their SIR online may download and print an SIR from the UCI Applicant Portal . Students must return the printed SIR along with the $250 deposit (if requested), made payable to UC Regents and mailed to the following address: Office of Undergraduate Admissions University of California, Irvine Irvine, CA 92697 Students who are not able to either submit their SIR electronically or download an SIR from the UCI Applicant Portal should contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 949-824-6703 . Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid and/or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Student Records Access and Disclosure At UCI, an “applicant” becomes a “student” at the time of submission of a positive SIR. Information regarding access to student records and disclosure of student record information (both public and confidential) may be found in the Appendix .

School or program and major-specific requirements are described in full in the academic unit sections. Students with identified learning and/or physical disabilities, including language-acquisition problems, are eligible to receive support through the Disability Services Center; telephone 949-824-7494 (voice), email: dsc@uci.edu . Staff can assist students from the time they are admitted to UCI until they graduate. Catalogue Rights Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major): (1) those in effect at the time of entrance, or (2) those subsequently established after entrance. A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions) must adhere to the graduation requirements: (1) in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or (2) those subsequently established. Students transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements either: (1) those in effect at the time of enrollment at UCI; (2) those subsequently established; or (3) those in effect at UCI when the student first entered a previous, accredited collegiate institution, provided that the student has been continuously enrolled in a collegiate institution and that entry was not more than four years prior to the time of enrollment at UCI. A transfer student who has had a break of enrollment of two consecutive semesters or three consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions) may follow the requirements in effect at UCI: (1) at the time of enrollment at UCI; (2) those subsequently established; or (3) those in effect at the time of reentry into a previous, accredited collegiate institution, provided that reentry was not more than four years prior to enrollment at UCI. A transfer student who has been continuously enrolled in college for more than four years prior to transfer may use: (1) the requirements in effect at the time of enrollment at UCI; (2) those subsequently established; or (3) those in effect at UCI four years prior to enrollment at UCI. All students, whether enrolled at UCI from their freshman year, readmitted, or transfer, may elect to fulfill general education requirements as specified above, independent of how they choose to meet all other graduation requirements (UC, UCI [with the exception of general education], school, and major). Students choosing to complete a minor, whether enrolled at UCI from their freshman year, readmitted, or transfer, may elect to fulfill minor requirements as specified above, independent of how they choose to meet all other graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major). Transfer students who complete one of the following options will be considered to have met the total UCI general education requirement except the upper-division writing requirement: (1) students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general education requirements of that college, upon approval of petition; (2) students who transfer from another UC campus and provide official documentation that they have met the general education requirements of that campus; (3) students who transfer from another UC campus and are in the process of completing the general education requirements of that campus, upon approval of petition, and who subsequently complete the remaining requirements of that campus at UCI; or (4) California Community College transfer students who have completed the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum. Transfer students may also elect to complete the UCI general education requirement. Minor Programs For certification in a minor, a student must obtain a minimum overall grade point average of at least C (2.0) in all courses required for the minor program. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Completion of the minor is noted on a student’s transcript. (Students are not required to minor in a program in order to graduate from UCI.) Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must submit an online Application for Graduation via the Student Access link at the University Registrar's Office website no later than the published deadline. Specific deadline dates for filing are established quarterly so that candidates’ academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Students should contact their academic counseling office for deadline and degree audit information. General Education (GE) Requirement UCI is committed to the values of a liberal education. One component of that commitment is the requirement that all undergraduates complete a set of general education (GE) requirements. General education courses introduce students to a range of ideas and intellectual activities that engage UCI scholars, providing both scope and balance to a University degree beyond the study of a specific major. The general education requirements are intended to help undergraduates place the specialized study undertaken in the major within a broader context. They are designed to cultivate the skills, knowledge, and understanding that will make students effective contributors to society and the world. The general education requirements should enable UCI undergraduates to apply the abilities developed in their studies to identify significant issues, gather and evaluate available evidence, analyze alternatives, reach conclusions, communicate the results effectively, and take considered actions. The general education requirement is a graduation requirement and, with the exception of the lower-division writing requirement, need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the general education requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: I. Writing (two lower-division plus one upper-division course) II. Science and Technology (three courses) III. Social and Behavioral Sciences (three courses) IV. Arts and Humanities (three courses) V. Quantitative, Symbolic, and Computational Reasoning , with subcategories Va and Vb (three courses that may also satisfy another GE category) VI. Language Other Than English (one course) VII. Multicultural Studies (one course that may also satisfy another GE category) VIII. International/Global Issues (one course that may also satisfy another GE category) The specific courses in each area that students may use to satisfy the requirements are listed below. When a general education course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the requirement. Students should refer to the Catalogue descriptions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. A course qualifies for a particular GE category based on its content rather than on the academic unit that offers it. However, to increase students’ exposure to a variety of disciplinary approaches, students are encouraged to choose GE courses from a wide range of schools and departments outside of the student’s major. NOTE: The following list of courses approved for GE is effective for the published academic year only. Because changes occur each year, students should consult the GE list annually to ensure that the courses they enroll in are on the list. GE credit is awarded for a course only if it appears on the list during the academic year when it is taken. To check the GE course offerings in a particular quarter, consult the Schedule of Classes on the University Registrar’s website . General Education Categories I. Writing Because of the importance of visual, oral, electronic, and written communication in every academic discipline, in the professions, and in public life, the University is committed to developing a variety of communication abilities in students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this broad commitment, but the concern for and attention to rhetorically effective, accurate writing is expected in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of two courses at the lower-division level beyond the UC Entry Level Writing requirement and one upper-division course in a discipline. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the UC Entry Level Writing requirement prior to fulfilling the UCI writing requirement. Students who have not completed the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be subject to probation. Academic English students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the seventh quarter following the completion of their AE courses or they will be subject to probation. The third course must be an upper-division writing course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of the lower-division requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. After completing this GE requirement, successful students should be able to do the following: Lower-division writing demonstrate rhetorically effective, accurate academic writing and communication across a variety of contexts, purposes, audiences, and media using appropriate stance, genre, style, and organization; develop flexible strategies for generating, revising, editing, and proofreading texts; develop abilities in critical reading across a variety of genres and media; and demonstrate information literacy skills by locating, evaluating, and integrating information gathered from multiple sources into a research project. Upper-division writing demonstrate rhetorically effective, discipline-specific writing for appropriate academic, professional, and public audiences; demonstrate, at an advanced level of competence, use of discipline-specific research methods, genres, modes of development, and formal conventions; and demonstrate advanced information literacy skills by locating, evaluating, and integrating information gathered from multiple sources into discipline-specific writing. Ia. Lower-Division Requirement The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Students may select from the courses specified below: WRITING 50 and WRITING 60 . WRITING 45 and WRITING 60 . Recommended students only. Completion of the writing component of Humanities Core with a grade of C or better in ( HUMAN 1AS or HUMAN H1AS or HUMAN 1BS or HUMAN H1BS or HUMAN 1BES ), and in HUMAN 1CS or HUMAN H1CS . Students who complete WRITING 45 or WRITING 50 with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division writing requirement one of the following courses in creative writing: WRITING 30 or WRITING 31 . Ib. Upper-Division Requirement The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). The requirement may be satisfied by completing one of the following options: An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly Schedule of Classes on the University Registrar’s website . NOTE: All courses approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement should have a “W” suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the “W” suffix, it does not satisfy the upper-division writing requirement. Majors in the School of Biological Sciences, Physics majors, and Pharmaceutical Sciences majors satisfy the upper-division writing requirement in the manner specified in those academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement should refer to the Academic Regulations and Procedures section for further information. Courses with an asterisk (*) can meet one or more GE requirement.  Click on the course for more information. Ib.

Grade Requirement A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required (1) overall, (2) in all of the courses required for the major program, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. In this context, “the courses required in the major program” are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student’s major (or programs, in the case of an interdisciplinary or interdepartmental major). A major can include additional courses required for the major in this set, with the approval of the Council on Education Policy. In this case, the list of additional courses is published in the Catalogue with the requirements for the major. Residence Requirement At least 36 of the final 45 units completed by a student for the bachelor’s degree must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program, the UCDC Academic Internship Program, the UC Center Sacramento Scholar Intern Program, or the International Opportunities Program with International Study Advance Contract. On This Page: Transfer Students: Completion of the UCI General Education Requirement Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum for STEM Transferability of Credit Limitations on Transfer Credit UCI Division of Continuing Education Important Resources for California Community College Students This section provides a guide for transfer students in understanding how their coursework from another collegiate institution applies to fulfilling UCI degree requirements. Transfer students should use this information in conjunction with the Requirements for a Bachelor’s Degree . Transfer students are required to meet University , general education , school, department, and major requirements described in the Catalogue. The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and has been mutually determined with a community college as being acceptable toward completion of the UCI general education requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major or the UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions about courses that may be used to satisfy UCI requirements. Transfer Students: Completion of the UCI General Education Requirement The general education requirements specify the courses students must take or units they must accumulate in each area. However, each student should consider the general education recommendation for their major, as it may be more important to concentrate on completing the many prerequisites for the major that are screened for in the selection process. Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI general education (GE) requirement by completing either: The current UCI GE requirement; one of the options listed in the Catalogue Rights section; or the California Community College Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC); or the California Community College Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum for STEM. Transfer students do not need to complete the UCI GE requirement prior to matriculating to UCI. The GE requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the lower-division writing requirement, which must be completed within the first three quarters of residency at UCI. NOTE: UCI operates on the quarter system. For the purpose of counting courses for the UCI GE requirement, one semester course is equivalent to one quarter course, and two semester courses are equivalent to three quarter courses. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum California Community College transfer students may satisfy the UCI GE requirement by completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC). The IGETC is a series of courses that California Community College students may complete to satisfy the freshman/sophomore level general education requirements before transferring to UCI. Fulfillment of the IGETC does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who do not complete IGETC prior to transfer may be eligible for partial certification from their community college. Partial certification is defined as completing all but two (2) courses on the IGETC pattern. Warning: Students need to meet minimum UC transfer admission requirements. Therefore, partial certification that acknowledges a deficiency in Area 1 and/or Area 2 may also indicate a student does not meet minimum transfer requirements. Please note: IGETC must be completed in total or partial IGETC certification must be completed prior to enrolling at UCI; students are responsible for requesting IGETC certification from their community college; and the IGETC certification should be submitted to the UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions no later than the end of the first quarter of UCI enrollment. Courses used to fulfill the IGETC must be completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of C or better.) Lists of specific approved courses which may be taken in fulfillment of the IGETC are available from California Community Colleges and at the ASSIST website . Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum Area 1. English Communication: One course in English composition and one course in critical thinking/English composition. Area 2. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning: One course. Area 3. Arts and Humanities: Three courses with at least one from the arts and one from the humanities. Area 4. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Three courses from at least two different disciplines, or an interdisciplinary sequence. Area 5. Physical and Biological Sciences: One physical science course and one biological science course, at least one of which includes a laboratory. Area 6. Language Other Than English: Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school courses in the same language. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum for STEM IGETC for STEM is a pattern of courses that California Community College students may complete to satisfy the lower-division GE requirements before transfer to UCI. IGETC for STEM is a separate IGETC track available for students planning to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. UC will accept IGETC for STEM only if: The earned associate degree for transfer (ADT) is at a California Community College that offers IGETC for STEM as an option for those degrees AND the UC major program or college accepts partial IGETC certification. Note: IGETC and IGETC for STEM are not an admission requirement. Completing it does not guarantee admission to UCI. Transferability of Credit The University of California awards unit credit for college courses completed at United States regionally accredited colleges and universities; or at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education (or higher-education authority/appropriate government agency) in another country that offers university-level academic degree program courses comparable to a U.S. associate's or bachelor's degree. To be accepted for credit, the courses must be comparable to those offered at any UC campus. All courses that meet the criteria are used in determining eligibility for admission.The transferability of coursework taken at other institutions for both newly admitted transfer students and for current UCI students who attend other institutions during summer sessions is determined by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Although the Office of Undergraduate Admissions may award unit or subject credit for courses completed at another institution, the courses may not necessarily apply to specific UCI degree requirements (i.e., general education or major requirements). Contact a College, school or department advisor regarding specific credit applications and limitations. Also, be aware of the residence requirements, UCI Requirements section , which are specific to the College or School. Courses for transfer must be reported on an official transcript from the original college/university and provided in a sealed envelope, or electronically submitted by a campus-acceptable vendor. UCI only accepts electronic transcripts from the following third party vendors: Parchment, Credentials eScrip-Safe. The UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions mailing address is: UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions Attention Official Documents Irvine, CA 92697-1075 An official transcript must bear the institution’s official seal and registrar’s signature. Duplicate Credit is Prohibited. Students may not receive unit credit or earn grade points for college courses in which the content duplicates material of a previously completed course or examination for which credit has already been granted, with the exception of the repeat of deficient (C-/D/F) course grades. Students should be advised that college courses taken before or while attending UC may duplicate AP, IB, and/or A-Level examinations. Additionally, exams may duplicate each other (for example AP and IB in the same subject area). If a student does duplicate an exam of the same subject content and/or a college course, we will award credit only once. Exceptions related to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credit and repeat of deficient grades can be found in their respective sections. Limitations on Transfer Credit Students will be granted up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any institution or combination of institutions. For units beyond the maximum, subject credit for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation will be granted and may be used to satisfy requirements. Please note: 1. Units earned through Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. 2. Units earned at any University of California campus (summer, extension/continuing education, cross/concurrent, and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. In addition, there is a limit to the number of units for which UC grants credit in the following areas: English as a Second Language courses: a maximum of 8 semester (12 quarter) units Physical education activity courses: a maximum of 4 semester (6 quarter) units UCI Division of Continuing Education UCI Division of Continuing Education (Extension) courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer UCI Division of Continuing Education course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in a UCI Division of Continuing Education course. UCI Division of Continuing Education courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned at UCI Division of Continuing Education may, though not in all instances, be calculated as part of the University GPA. Note: Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the student’s academic dean. Important Resources for California Community College Students Students anticipating transfer to UCI from a California Community College are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The counselors, with the aid of that college’s UC Transfer Course Agreement (UCTCA), can advise students about California Community College courses and units which will transfer to the University. In addition, staff in the UCI Office of Undergraduate Admissions can advise students about the transferability of courses. The ASSIST site provides information regarding: University of California Transfer Course Agreements. Selected Major Preparation Articulation Agreements for all California Community Colleges. The agreements list all lower division course requirements for select majors at UCI and the courses students can complete at their community colleges that satisfy these requirements. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) course list. IGETC enables students at California Community Colleges to complete UCI General Education requirements before transfer. School, Departmental, and Major Requirements In addition to the University and UCI requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement may also help fulfill the UCI general education requirement. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Information on specific degree requirements and courses is available in the academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), and should make certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. Transfer students should read the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor’s Degree. Students should note that with the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student’s school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Additional information on grading is located in the Academic Regulations and Procedures section.
