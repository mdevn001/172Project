International transfer of personal information: Personal information provided to us by users outside of the United States may be\n                     transferred to other countries such as the United States, where data protection laws\n                     may differ from those of your home country.  By providing us with your information,\n                     you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to the United States\n                     and processed on servers within the United States.

Cookie Policy Cookies Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing\n                     a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your\n                     browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the\n                     Sites.  A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session\n                     cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after\n                     you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent\n                     visits to the Sites.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s\n                     directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.\n                     You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie\n                     is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly\n                     if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Google Analytics: We use a tool called “Google Analytics,” a web analytics service provided by Google,\n                     Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites.  Google Analytics collects information\n                     such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, and what other sites\n                     were visited prior to coming to our Sites.  We use the information we get from Google\n                     Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address\n                     assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying\n                     information.  Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type\n                     of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location,\n                     however we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics\n                     with personally identifiable information.  Although Google Analytics plants a permanent\n                     cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit\n                     the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’ s ability to use\n                     and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites\n                     is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\n                     You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites\n                     by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you\n                     may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access\n                     a web page.  When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record\n                     certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.  These\n                     server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses\n                     or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating\n                     system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs,\n                     domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which\n                     are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.  No personal\n                     information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear\n                     gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. California Do Not Track Disclosures California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January\n                     1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator\n                     responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings.  DNT is a feature offered by some\n                     browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing\n                     is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.\n                     We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users’\n                     online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses\n                     our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals. How we share your information: We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes\n                     listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process\n                     your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors\n                     who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid\n                     or payment processing, education management, and web hosting).  The University may\n                     also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators\n                     (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement\n                     applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue\n                     available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal\n                     information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other\n                     University policies and applicable laws and regulations.  We will not distribute or\n                     share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision\n                     (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party\n                     without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving\n                     possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including\n                     but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency\n                     or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network\n                     operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our\n                     Sites or services for illegal activities.  We may report to law enforcement agencies\n                     any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal\n                     information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity,\n                     including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or\n                     litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law\n                     or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant\n                     permission to us in accordance with this Notice. How we protect your information: We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the\n                     integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access,\n                     and illegal use or disclosure.  Such personal information is stored by the University\n                     in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management\n                     of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access\n                     to personal information is limited to those members of the University’s staff whose\n                     work requires such access.  Confidential information is destroyed according to the\n                     University’s records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews\n                     to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood\n                     and followed. The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember\n                     that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is\n                     100% secure.  While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your\n                     personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information\n                     you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission\n                     of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of\n                     our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information\n                     may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,\n                     technical, or managerial safeguards.  While we strive to protect your personal information\n                     and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers\n                     and the information on those computers.  For additional information on online privacy\n                     and security, please see the University’s policies and procedures related to Information\n                     Security; you may also consult with the California Attorney General’s Privacy Enforcement\n                     and Protection website.In the event that personal information is compromised as a\n                     result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons\n                     whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification\n                     procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required\n                     by applicable law.

The ceremony was hosted by Fresno State’s Cross Cultural and Gender Center , with speeches from University President Saúl Jiménez-Sandoval, Fresno City Council Vice President Annalisa Perea, Fresno State student Jonathan Gonzalez and recent graduate Cherika Gamble. The flag was designed by American artist Daniel Quasar in 2018. Quasar’s design adapted the iconic rainbow flag to be more inclusive within the LGBTQ+ community, adding a chevron with stripes colored specifically to represent LGBTQ+ community members of color and transgender individuals. “For me, it represents a change in the university and in the community — prioritizing our queer students and our allied students, staff and faculty; prioritizing representation for them,” said Lexey Jenkins, lead student coordinator of LGBTQ+ programs and services at the Cross Cultural and Gender Center and inaugural Jeffery Robinson Humanics Scholar for the Bulldog Pride Fund. “Being queer is an invisible identity…so it can be very isolating. It’s important for queer students, staff and faculty to see visible representations of their identity,” Raising of the progress pride flag on campus took place amid a larger nationwide struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and liberties. Historically, the university has also seen its own LGBTQ+ students fight for visibility and acceptance on campus. In 1987, after founding the Gay Lesbian Student Alliance (now known as United Student Pride) and building a booth for the group on campus, students faced immediate backlash from their peers, said Dr. Peter Robertson, founding member of the group and director of alumni connections for the Fresno State Alumni Association. “ I can’t go back and sugarcoat the experiences that I lived through as a student and saw my classmates go through, where it’s [us] being threatened, having people scream Bible verses at you, walking by and spitting on you…It was a very, very emotional, stressful time to be a student,” Robertson said in an interview with The Collegian . The group’s booth was victim to an arson attack and subsequent acts of vandalism and anti-LGBTQ+ demonstrations. Despite the initial resistance, United Student Pride has existed on campus for 36 years. “I’m aware of the history that’s marginalized the LGBTQ community…and I’m aware of the great gifts that the LGBTQ community brings to the community,” University President Saúl Jiménez-Sandoval said. “I’m going to create a Fresno State, together with you, that includes and honors you.” The university has taken significant strides to become a more inclusive and accepting space for its LGBTQ+ students, including offering an annual Rainbow Graduation Celebration, gender affirming care services at the Student Health and Counseling Center and a newly instated LGBTQ2+ minor . Jenkins recognized and celebrated these changes at the university. She also shared that she hopes to one day see the addition of a statue to represent an LGBTQ+ historical figure in the Fresno State Peace Garden.

Like all state colleges and universities – called SCUs – we have a student-focused\n                     culture that centers on learning and teaching. Members of AASCU also share a long-standing\n                     commitment to underserved student populations and a dedication to research and creativity\n                     that makes them uniquely different from land grant or research universities and community\n                     and technical colleges. Fresno State is also an important part of the economic progress\n                     and cultural development of Central California. We and our fellow state colleges and universities foster a value system centered around\n                     the concept of “Opportunities for All”– that SCUs are the education choice that creates\n                     bright futures for all of the region’s students, and thus become economic, cultural\n                     and social drivers for their regions and states. Every SCU shares three core values: Quality, Accessibility and Responsibility. High Quality: We have a student-centered focus that emphasizes learning and teaching as a core\n                     institutional belief. Our students are taught and mentored by a faculty of scholars\n                     and are exposed to a full range of educational opportunities in smaller class sizes.\n                     We support a broad range of different learning styles and opportunities – from our\n                     Smittcamp Family Honors Program to hands-on applied undergraduate research with our\n                     faculty, both in the lab and out in the field. Accessible: As a state university, Fresno State provides a viable, high quality educational experience\n                     to a diverse cross-section of the region’s residents,  including nontraditional students\n                     or groups that historically have been underrepresented in higher education. We celebrate\n                     diversity, build inclusiveness and enable partnerships that help students succeed. Responsible: We create a skilled workforce that supports the region’s and the state’s business\n                     needs while advancing economic progress and cultural development. We prepare our students\n                     for a life of leadership and service and enhance their ability to attain financial\n                     independence after graduation. Fresno State, like its peer SCUs, is a smart investment, offering a high quality,\n                     accessible and affordable choice to earning a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree.\n                     We are proud to share the mission of our SCU peers to make higher education available\n                     to anyone who is willing to work hard  to be successful.

Law Enforcement A law enforcement officer can take a report, help access confidential support, and\n                                 provide access to medical care after a sexual assault. Police departments are available\n                                 for response 24/7. Sexual assaults can be reported at any time (immediately following, days or years\n                                 after the incident). Statutes of limitations vary, depending on the type of crime/sexual\n                                 assault and by state. The evidence available, investigations and treatment options\n                                 may also be impacted by the length of time that has passed since the assault. A sexual\n                                 assault counselor/advocate or law enforcement can provide you with specific information\n                                 related to these factors. Deciding to report a sexual assault to law enforcement is a very private a personal\n                                             decision. It’s ok to report to police, not report, or not k​nowing if one wants to\n                                             report. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can provide all information about reporting\n                                             options so the victim/survivor can make an informed decision.

Specialized sexual assault nurse examiners collect\n                                 samples from a victim/survivor that may contain DNA evidence to help a potential prosecution. A victim/survivor has the right to have a support person with them and can say no\n                                 to any part of the exam. If a person decides they want a SAFE, the sexual assault counselor/advocate can provide\n                                             more detailed information and help coordinate response with police and the SAFE nurse. There are two types of exams: a VAWA exam and evidentiary exam VAWA Exam Evidentiary Exam Report Requirement Does not require police report. Requires police report. Who Helps Access Exam This option is available through your campus sexual assault counselor/advocate as\n                                             well as your local sexual assault/rape crisis center. A police officer will schedule the exam. Who are Exams For These exams may be appropriate for those that are not ready to speak to and involve\n                                             law enforcement. Evidence from VAWA exams in California must be preserved for two\n                                             years in the event that a victim/survivor does want to engage with law enforcement. These exams are appropriate for those that would like immediate law enforcement involvement.\n                                             Evidentiary exams are intended to collect forensic evidence for use in criminal prosecution.\n                                             An evidentiary exam is an option available by filing a report with law enforcement. Level of Police Involvement Police officers will not take a report and should not engage with the victim/survivor.\n                                             However, the police department will collect the evidence kit and store it until (and\n                                             if) the victim/survivor decides to file a police report/criminal charge. Police officers may: Take a police report by interviewing the victim/survivor and possibly any friends/witnesses Coordinate and schedule the SAFE Provide transportation to the SAFE location Contact a sexual assault counselor/advocate to provide emotional support during the\n                                                   process Note about at-home rape kits: Although well-intentioned, evidence from at home “rape kits\" may not be admissible\n                                    for evidence. Preserving clothing with potential DNA evidence: Necessary evidence could be present in the clothes someone wore during the assault\n                                 — this evidence can be preserved by being stored in paper bags (mold grows in plastic\n                                 bags.) If the person decides to file a police report or obtain a sexual assault forensic\n                                 exam (SAFE), the clothes can be provided to them for evidence collection. More information about sexual assault forensic exams: https://www.rainn.org/articles/rape-kit Other Evidence A sexual assault forensic exam is one way to preserve evidence, but it's not the only\n                                 way. Here is a list of other evidence that can be preserved: Video – from door cameras, surveillance cameras, social media posts, etc. Names of people that may have information such as: Eyewitnesses – people who saw behavior or level of intoxication before the assault\n                                    or witnessed the assault Outcry witnesses – people you told about what happened Any messages or communication with the perpetrator, including voicemails, texts, email\n                                    and social media messaging (taking screenshots can be helpful) Information/documentation about or photos of injuries Receipts – showing where you were or what you were doing Immediate Medical Care It's ok if someone does not wish to file a police report or get a sexual assault forensic\n                                 exam. That said, depending on the nature of the assault, it may still be important\n                                 to obtain medical care to address potential injuries, exposure to sexually transmitted\n                                 infections (STI's), or if there may be a risk of pregnancy. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can help explore and address issues such as resources\n                                             to help pay for medical care and confidentiality Note: Emergency contraceptives are also available at local pharmacies without prescription.

This means that a healthcare provider may need to make a police report if\n                                 their patient discloses that the injury they are seeking treatment for was caused\n                                 by abuse or assault. The victim/survivor, however, has the right to not speak to law\n                                 enforcement or share additional information. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can help someone navigate any potential report made by a medical provider. For example, if someone does not wish to report\n                                             to law enforcement, the counselor/advocate can help say no to a police report without feeling intimated.

Like all state colleges and universities – called SCUs – we have a student-focused\n                     culture that centers on learning and teaching. Members of AASCU also share a long-standing\n                     commitment to underserved student populations and a dedication to research and creativity\n                     that makes them uniquely different from land grant or research universities and community\n                     and technical colleges. Fresno State is also an important part of the economic progress\n                     and cultural development of Central California. We and our fellow state colleges and universities foster a value system centered around\n                     the concept of “Opportunities for All”– that SCUs are the education choice that creates\n                     bright futures for all of the region’s students, and thus become economic, cultural\n                     and social drivers for their regions and states. Every SCU shares three core values: Quality, Accessibility and Responsibility. High Quality: We have a student-centered focus that emphasizes learning and teaching as a core\n                     institutional belief. Our students are taught and mentored by a faculty of scholars\n                     and are exposed to a full range of educational opportunities in smaller class sizes.\n                     We support a broad range of different learning styles and opportunities – from our\n                     Smittcamp Family Honors Program to hands-on applied undergraduate research with our\n                     faculty, both in the lab and out in the field. Accessible: As a state university, Fresno State provides a viable, high quality educational experience\n                     to a diverse cross-section of the region’s residents,  including nontraditional students\n                     or groups that historically have been underrepresented in higher education. We celebrate\n                     diversity, build inclusiveness and enable partnerships that help students succeed. Responsible: We create a skilled workforce that supports the region’s and the state’s business\n                     needs while advancing economic progress and cultural development. We prepare our students\n                     for a life of leadership and service and enhance their ability to attain financial\n                     independence after graduation. Fresno State, like its peer SCUs, is a smart investment, offering a high quality,\n                     accessible and affordable choice to earning a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree.\n                     We are proud to share the mission of our SCU peers to make higher education available\n                     to anyone who is willing to work hard  to be successful.

Law Enforcement A law enforcement officer can take a report, help access confidential support, and\n                                 provide access to medical care after a sexual assault. Police departments are available\n                                 for response 24/7. Sexual assaults can be reported at any time (immediately following, days or years\n                                 after the incident). Statutes of limitations vary, depending on the type of crime/sexual\n                                 assault and by state. The evidence available, investigations and treatment options\n                                 may also be impacted by the length of time that has passed since the assault. A sexual\n                                 assault counselor/advocate or law enforcement can provide you with specific information\n                                 related to these factors. Deciding to report a sexual assault to law enforcement is a very private a personal\n                                             decision. It’s ok to report to police, not report, or not k​nowing if one wants to\n                                             report. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can provide all information about reporting\n                                             options so the victim/survivor can make an informed decision.

Specialized sexual assault nurse examiners collect\n                                 samples from a victim/survivor that may contain DNA evidence to help a potential prosecution. A victim/survivor has the right to have a support person with them and can say no\n                                 to any part of the exam. If a person decides they want a SAFE, the sexual assault counselor/advocate can provide\n                                             more detailed information and help coordinate response with police and the SAFE nurse. There are two types of exams: a VAWA exam and evidentiary exam VAWA Exam Evidentiary Exam Report Requirement Does not require police report. Requires police report. Who Helps Access Exam This option is available through your campus sexual assault counselor/advocate as\n                                             well as your local sexual assault/rape crisis center. A police officer will schedule the exam. Who are Exams For These exams may be appropriate for those that are not ready to speak to and involve\n                                             law enforcement. Evidence from VAWA exams in California must be preserved for two\n                                             years in the event that a victim/survivor does want to engage with law enforcement. These exams are appropriate for those that would like immediate law enforcement involvement.\n                                             Evidentiary exams are intended to collect forensic evidence for use in criminal prosecution.\n                                             An evidentiary exam is an option available by filing a report with law enforcement. Level of Police Involvement Police officers will not take a report and should not engage with the victim/survivor.\n                                             However, the police department will collect the evidence kit and store it until (and\n                                             if) the victim/survivor decides to file a police report/criminal charge. Police officers may: Take a police report by interviewing the victim/survivor and possibly any friends/witnesses Coordinate and schedule the SAFE Provide transportation to the SAFE location Contact a sexual assault counselor/advocate to provide emotional support during the\n                                                   process Note about at-home rape kits: Although well-intentioned, evidence from at home “rape kits\" may not be admissible\n                                    for evidence. Preserving clothing with potential DNA evidence: Necessary evidence could be present in the clothes someone wore during the assault\n                                 — this evidence can be preserved by being stored in paper bags (mold grows in plastic\n                                 bags.) If the person decides to file a police report or obtain a sexual assault forensic\n                                 exam (SAFE), the clothes can be provided to them for evidence collection. More information about sexual assault forensic exams: https://www.rainn.org/articles/rape-kit Other Evidence A sexual assault forensic exam is one way to preserve evidence, but it's not the only\n                                 way. Here is a list of other evidence that can be preserved: Video – from door cameras, surveillance cameras, social media posts, etc. Names of people that may have information such as: Eyewitnesses – people who saw behavior or level of intoxication before the assault\n                                    or witnessed the assault Outcry witnesses – people you told about what happened Any messages or communication with the perpetrator, including voicemails, texts, email\n                                    and social media messaging (taking screenshots can be helpful) Information/documentation about or photos of injuries Receipts – showing where you were or what you were doing Immediate Medical Care It's ok if someone does not wish to file a police report or get a sexual assault forensic\n                                 exam. That said, depending on the nature of the assault, it may still be important\n                                 to obtain medical care to address potential injuries, exposure to sexually transmitted\n                                 infections (STI's), or if there may be a risk of pregnancy. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can help explore and address issues such as resources\n                                             to help pay for medical care and confidentiality Note: Emergency contraceptives are also available at local pharmacies without prescription.

This means that a healthcare provider may need to make a police report if\n                                 their patient discloses that the injury they are seeking treatment for was caused\n                                 by abuse or assault. The victim/survivor, however, has the right to not speak to law\n                                 enforcement or share additional information. A sexual assault counselor/advocate can help someone navigate any potential report made by a medical provider. For example, if someone does not wish to report\n                                             to law enforcement, the counselor/advocate can help say no to a police report without feeling intimated.

Academic\n                  Regulations page contents: Academic Standing Bachelor's/Master's/Doctoral Degrees Choice of Catalog Computer Requirement Definition of Key Terms Dispute Resolution Enrollment in Graduate-level (200-297) Courses Explanation of Grades Grade Symbols and Grade Points Grading Policies and Practices Readmission of Disqualified Students, Undergraduate and Graduate Scholarship Status Student Absences Transcript Evaluation Transcripts and Grade Reports Academic Standing Satisfactory Standing. Satisfactory academic standing means at least a C average (2.0 grade point average\n                  or twice as many grade points as units attempted) in both campus and cumulative GPAs\n                  and satisfactory progress toward a degree for undergraduate and postbaccalaureate\n                  students without a master's degree objective. Graduate (master's degree) students\n                  must maintain at least a B average (3.0 grade point average). A student (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) whose campus or cumulative\n                  grade point average falls below the satisfactory academic standing level is placed\n                  on probation and is disqualified if the grade point average falls below probation\n                  levels. For more information, see the Disqualification section. Probation. Undergraduate students are placed on academic probation, a warning, if their: Cumulative grade point average (GPA) based on total units attempted at all colleges\n                     is 1.99 or below. Campus grade point average (GPA) based on all units attempted at California State\n                     University, Fresno is 1.99 or below. Students remain on academic probation until both overall and California State University,\n                  Fresno grade point averages are 2.0 or better, or until they are disqualified under\n                  one of the provisions of the disqualification regulations. These regulations also apply to all postbaccalaureate students except those enrolled\n                  in master's programs. The latter are expected to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least\n                  3.0 in all units attempted subsequent to admission to the master's program. Master's\n                  students who fall below the required GPA are placed on probation. Students enrolled in master's programs are required to maintain a minimum 3.0 postbaccalaureate\n                  cumulative grade point average (GPA) prior to advancement to candidacy. Search Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies. A graduate student may be placed on administrative-academic probation for withdrawal\n                  from a substantial portion of a program in two successive terms or in any three terms;\n                  for repeated failure to progress toward a degree; or for failure to comply with an\n                  academic requirement or regulation that is routine for all students or for a defined\n                  group of students. Disqualification. After being placed on academic probation, if a student's campus or cumulative GPA\n                  remains at 1.99 or below they may be academically disqualified based on the criteria\n                  below: As a freshman (fewer than 30 semester hours of college work completed) the student\n                     falls below a grade point average of 1.50 in all units attempted or in all units attempted\n                     at the campus where enrolled As a sophomore (30 through 59 semester hours of college work completed) the student\n                     falls below a grade point average of 1.70 in all units attempted or in all units attempted\n                     at the campus where enrolled As a junior (60 through 89 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls\n                     below a grade point average of 1.85 in all units attempted or in all units attempted\n                     at the campus where enrolled As a senior/postbaccalaureate (90 or more semester hours of college work completed)\n                     the student falls below a grade point average of 1.95 in all units attempted or in\n                     all units attempted at the campus where enrolled Graduate (master's) students are disqualified if their cumulative California State\n                  University, Fresno grade point average falls below 2.0. Note: A continuing student with an academic standing of Probation , Probation: Disqualification Range , or Readmitted on Probation can “Stop Out” for one semester and still maintain registration eligibility without\n                  the need to reapply to the University for admission or to request an educational leave\n                  of absence. New and returning undergraduate and graduate students cannot \"stop out\"\n                  for one semester until they establish continuing eligibility status. To gain continuing\n                  eligibility into the next semester, a student must be enrolled through the tenth day\n                  of instruction. Students receiving veterans’ educational benefits will be ruled ineligible for continued\n                  benefits if, after one semester of unsatisfactory achievement (probation or disqualification),\n                  they do not return to academic Good Standing at the completion of the next semester. A graduate student placed on administrative-academic probation may be disqualified\n                  for the following reasons: If they fail to meet the conditions for removal of probation, Become subject to academic probation while on administrative-academic probation, or Again become subject to administrative-academic probation for the same or similar\n                     reasons.

California State University, Fresno also offers\n                  a doctoral degree (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership. See Kremen School of Education and Human Development for public school credentials for which the university is authorized to recommend\n                  candidates. Choice of Catalog Election of Regulations. An undergraduate student or postbaccalaureate student pursuing a second bachelor’s\n                  degree must fulfill degree requirements from one catalog, not the most favorable requirements\n                  from two or more catalogs. As long as a student maintains “continuous attendance,”\n                  he or she may elect, for purposes of fulfilling graduation requirements, one of the\n                  following: The catalog in effect at the time a student enters a California community college\n                     or a campus of the California State University system. The catalog in effect at the time a student enters California State University, Fresno. The catalog in effect at the time the student applies to graduate from California\n                     State University, Fresno. Continuous attendance is defined as being officially enrolled at least one semester\n                  or two quarters during a calendar year. Students must demonstrate progress toward\n                  fulfillment of degree requirements to maintain registration eligibility as a continuing\n                  student. A student may not begin “continuous attendance” while still enrolled in high\n                  school. Once a student establishes catalog rights in the CSU or California Community College\n                  system, he or she may attend any accredited college or university (outside the CSU\n                  and California Community College system) or take a planned educational leave for no\n                  more than two years and maintain his or her continuous attendance status. (See Leave of Absence .) Any break in attendance of one calendar year or longer ends a student's continuous\n                  attendance status. This results in the loss of catalog rights to all catalog choices\n                  prior to the break in attendance. It should be noted that enrollment in Open University,\n                  extension, and correspondence courses does not establish catalog rights nor contribute\n                  toward continuous attendance to maintain catalog rights. A loss of catalog rights\n                  could result in one or more additional semesters to meet new catalog requirements\n                  especially in the major and/or General Education. Once a student graduates, however,\n                  all rights to the original catalog are terminated. Graduate (master's) students fulfill requirements based on an approved advancement\n                  to candidacy petition. These requirements are based on departmental and university\n                  requirements as published in the current catalog at the time of advancement. Continuous\n                  enrollment is likewise defined differently for master's students. (Search Graduate\n                  Studies.) Computer Requirement At Fresno State, computers and communications links to remote resources are recognized\n                  as being integral to the education and research experience. Every student is required\n                  to have his/her own computer or other personal access to a device with all the recommended\n                  software. The recommended standards for devices and software, which may vary by academic\n                  major, are updated periodically and are available from the Kennel Bookstore. The university\n                  provides students access to some software free of charge or at reduced rates. Faculty will presume that students have 24-hour\n                  access to a device and the necessary communication links to the University's information\n                  resources. Fresno State maintains a limited number of workstations in various labs\n                  and laptops for checkout to facilitate this access. It also provides a Wi-Fi network\n                  on campus for access to the Internet. Definition of Key Terms Additional Requirements. Courses from one or more departments or programs that are required in support of\n                  the major. Such courses are not included in the minimum 2.0 grade point average required\n                  in the major for graduation and may be waived or substituted at the discretion of\n                  the major department or program. Additional requirements normally may be applied toward\n                  a minor. Additional requirements may also be applied toward General Education unless\n                  specifically prohibited by the major department. Certificate . A set of interdisciplinary courses comprising of a minimum of 12 units focusing\n                  on a special area of study. Students are not required to be matriculated or be undergraduates.\n                  Certificates are awarded upon completion of the program regardless of catalog year\n                  or degree status. The university awards three types of certificates. They include\n                  the Certificate of Completion, the Certificate of Special Study, and the Certificate\n                  of Advanced Study. See Certificates in Degree Requirements for more information. The Certificate of Completion is awarded for successfully completing a planned educational experience designed\n                     for specific academic objectives. The Certificate of Special Study is awarded for successfully completing a structured program of educational experiences\n                        of at least twelve semester units, determined in advance by a department or school,\n                        and consisting of upper division (100-199) courses, professional (300-399) courses,\n                        and related activities. Certificate of Advanced Study . A certificate program of special study at the postbaccalaureate level. Concurrent Enrollment. The term concurrent enrollment is used to describe several different types of enrollment: Open University Enrollment. Nonmatriculated students may enroll in regular California State University, Fresno\n                     classes through Continuing and Global Education. Concurrent Enrollment at Other CSU Campuses. CSU students may attend two CSU campuses simultaneously. This type of enrollment\n                     is not often used by California State University, Fresno students because of the distance\n                     to other CSU campuses. (See the registration section for details.) Concurrent Enrollment at a Non-CSU College or University. While enrolled at California State University, Fresno, students may enroll for additional\n                     courses at another institution outside the CSU system. The course load in the combined\n                     enrollment program may not exceed the maximum unit load restrictions for California\n                     State University, Fresno. (See the registration section for details.) Core. A common set of courses within a major or minor that all students are required to\n                  complete. Degree Progress Report (DPR) . The DPR is a tool used by students and advisors to guide the advising process. Students\n                  may print their own DPR through self-service in the student portal, My Fresno State.\n                  The DPR shows the student’s progress in a chosen degree program, incorporating courses\n                  completed at California State University, Fresno and transfer institutions. The DPR\n                  illustrates how courses apply toward the student’s declared major, General Education,\n                  and degree requirements. It also displays a list of approved courses for each requirement\n                  to be completed. Double-Counting. Allowing one course to fulfill two separate requirements concurrently; e.g., allowing\n                  one course to fulfill both a major requirement and the upper-division writing skills\n                  requirement, or allowing one course to fulfill both a major requirement and General\n                  Education requirement. Electives. Courses/units a student selects to complete the total unit requirement for the baccalaureate\n                  degree and/or to complete requirements for the major. Grade Point Average (GPA). The grade point average is a measure of academic scholarship and performance which\n                  is computed by dividing units attempted into grade points earned. Three separate GPAs\n                  are computed: Cumulative GPA for all baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate units by degree objective. Cumulative GPA for total California State University, Fresno units. GPA for that semester only. A minimum of a C average (2.0 GPA) for units in the major, all California State University, Fresno\n                  units, and total units is required for a baccalaureate degree. (Search for Grade Symbols\n                  and Grade Points, Degree Requirements.) Master's degree students have a higher minimum\n                  GPA requirement. (Search for Graduate Studies Advancement to Candidacy, Grade Requirements.) Major. Set of required courses from one or more departments designed to provide students\n                  with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to pursue a specific career\n                  and/or advanced study. A student must earn a 2.0 grade point average in all courses\n                  required for the major, except \"additional requirements,\" in order to graduate. (Minimum\n                  Title 5 requirements: B.A. 24 units of which 12 must be upper division exclusive of\n                  General Education; B.S. 36 units of which 18 must be upper division exclusive of General\n                  Education.) Minor. In addition to academic majors, the university offers a number of minors. A minor\n                  is a formal set of courses in a designated subject area distinct from a student's\n                  major. The intent of a minor is to provide a condensed and cohesive academic experience,\n                  in addition to a major. Minors consist of a minimum of 12 semester units, at least\n                  6 of which must be upper-division residence units. Minors must be completed with a\n                  minimum GPA of 2.0. Minors offered by academic departments and programs are listed\n                  in the minors section of the catalog. Detailed descriptions are found in the listings of the particular\n                  departments and programs. Courses in the minor may not also count toward a student's\n                  major except as Additional Requirements to that major. However, courses fulfilling\n                  requirements for a minor usually may be counted toward General Education. Refer to\n                  the description of the specific minor for exceptions. A student may earn a maximum of two minors provided that the requirements above are\n                  met for each and that at least 12 units in each of the two minors are distinct and\n                  include at least 6 upper-division units in residence. Minors will not appear on a\n                  diploma. My Degree Plan . My Degree Plan is an interactive planning tool students may use to plan courses\n                  for future semesters. It allows students to validate their plan against the DPR or\n                  Roadmap to ensure efficient planning towards meeting graduation requirements. Option. Set of required courses within a major in addition to the major core courses that\n                  emphasizes one important aspect of that school or college, department, or program.\n                  The option in a major will appear on a diploma. Emphasis . Set of required courses that focuses on a specific area within a major. An emphasis\n                  or area of emphasis does not appear on the diploma or the official transcript. Prerequisite Requirements. Prerequisite courses must be completed prior to enrollment in the listed course;\n                  corequisite courses must be completed prior to or concurrently with the listed course.\n                  Students who do not meet these requirements may be disenrolled by the instructor or\n                  by the university. Recommended Courses. Courses that the department faculty believe would be beneficial for a student to\n                  take but are not mandated or required as part of the major. Roadmap. The Roadmap is a planning tool designed to assist students and advisors in developing\n                  a course scheduling strategy to maximize potential. Roadmaps provide students with\n                  the best recommended sequence of courses for success, and ultimately, degree completion. Units. A credit or semester unit represents one hour of class work per week for one semester.\n                  It is assumed that two hours of preparation are required for each hour in class. Three\n                  hours of laboratory per week is the equivalent of one unit. In a limited number of\n                  courses two hours of laboratory per week are the equivalent of one unit. Also, two\n                  hours of activity or studio (art, dance, music, physical education) are normally equivalent\n                  to one unit of credit. One quarter unit of credit is equivalent to two-thirds of a\n                  semester unit. Units Attempted (UA) and Units Earned (UE) are terms that appear on the student’s\n                  transcript and evaluation. Units attempted is the column used for GPA calculation.\n                  Units earned is the column used to determine units completed toward the total unit\n                  requirement for the degree. Dispute Resolution A student-related dispute could arise out of a decision or action in the course of\n                  official duty by a member of the faculty, staff, or administration of California State\n                  University, Fresno. The decision or action could be alleged as discriminatory, contrary\n                  to accepted academic relationships and procedures, or restrictive of the rights of\n                  any student of the university to fair treatment. The purpose of the dispute resolution\n                  process is to provide a mechanism for students to have a third party review the situation. The student must first make a good faith effort to resolve the matter informally by\n                  talking directly with the individual concerned, the individual's direct supervisor\n                  or department chair, and the director of the unit or college/school dean. If resolution\n                  is not effected through the informal procedures, for assistance students should contact\n                  the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. Enrollment in Graduate-level (200-297) Courses Enrollment in graduate-level (200-297) courses is limited to those who have been officially\n                  admitted to a graduate degree, advanced certificate, or credential program. However,\n                  there is a special program for last-semester undergraduate seniors who want to enroll\n                  in 200-level courses. All criteria listed on the Undergraduate Petition to Enroll\n                  in Graduate (200-level) Courses must be met. This petition, available from the Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies, should be filed prior to the semester in which the\n                  student desires enrollment in 200-level course(s). Explanation of Grades Audit Status (AU). Auditors must submit the Audit Grading Option Form no later than the 20th day of\n                  instruction in which you are taking the course. Audit grading basis option IS NOT\n                  available through the Student Portal registration system. Review the information and\n                  regulations for Audit below before completing the required form. Enrollment as an auditor is subject to permission of the instructor. Enrollment in\n                  a course as an auditor shall be permitted only after students otherwise eligible to\n                  enroll on a credit basis have had an opportunity to do so. Auditors are subject to\n                  the same fee structure as credit students and regular class attendance is expected.\n                  Once enrolled as an auditor, a student may not change to credit status unless such\n                  a change is requested no later than the last day to add classes (20th day of instruction)\n                  in that term. A student who is enrolled for credit may not change to audit status\n                  after the fourth week of instruction. Regular class attendance is expected and the student may be required to participate\n                  in any or all classroom activities at the discretion of the instructor. Audit courses do not give students any degree credit and are not used in a master's\n                  program. Credit/No Credit Grading (CR/NC). The credit/no credit grading policy at California State University, Fresno is designed\n                  to encourage academic exploration outside the major field of study. The policy also\n                  recognizes that in certain types of courses, student performance is best evaluated\n                  in terms of credit/no credit grading rather than through the traditional letter grades. Neither the CR nor NC grade is included in the calculation of the grade point average.\n                  The grade of CR is assigned if the student's work is judged to be equivalent to an\n                  A, B, or C grade as applicable to regular enrollment in an undergraduate course or\n                  equivalent to an A or B grade in a 200-level course. The NC grade is assigned if the student's work is not equivalent to these standards: General conditions and limitations. Some courses are not available for CR/NC grading, (see individual course description),\n                     while others are designated as available for CR/NC grading only. All other courses\n                     are available for CR/NC grading; however, a student may not enroll in more than 6\n                     units of CR/NC graded coursework per semester. The decision to enroll for CR/NC grading\n                     must be made prior to the end of the fourth week of instruction and the decision must\n                     be recorded by the student by using the Web registration system. Undergraduate Students. A student may not elect CR/NC graded coursework to satisfy requirements for the major\n                     unless the courses have been designated CR/NC only. A maximum of 24 semester units\n                     at California State University, Fresno of CR/NC evaluated credit, including all coursework\n                     taken CR/NC only, may be applied toward the degree. Graduate Students . Credit for coursework earned through CR/NC in fall 1978 and in subsequent semesters\n                        may not be applied toward the master's degree unless the course has been designated\n                        as available for CR/NC only by the Graduate Committee. A maximum of 6 units of CR/NC\n                        only credit may be applied to a 30-unit master's degree program and a maximum of 12\n                        units of CR/NC only credit may be applied to a 60-unit program. Incomplete (I). The symbol I (Incomplete Authorized) indicates that a portion of required coursework\n                  has not been completed and evaluated in the prescribed time period due to unforeseen\n                  - but fully justified - reasons, and that there is still a possibility of earning\n                  credit. Such reasons must meet the criteria of serious and compelling and occur late\n                  in the semester. The grade of I is only appropriate when the student requesting it\n                  has completed a minimum of two-thirds of the work for the course with a passing grade.\n                  The instructor of record retains the right to decide whether or not an I grade is\n                  appropriate. It is the responsibility of the student to bring pertinent information\n                  to the attention of the instructor and to determine from the instructor the remaining\n                  course requirements that must be satisfied to remove the incomplete. The faculty member\n                  should complete the online incomplete contract detailing the work that needs to be\n                  completed. A final grade is assigned when the work agreed upon has been completed\n                  and evaluated. Students may not enroll in a course for which they have an I grade. Normally it is expected that the student will make up an I grade during the next semester;\n                  however, it must be made up within one calendar year immediately following the last\n                  day of the semester/session during which it was assigned. This limitation prevails\n                  whether or not the student maintains continuous enrollment. Failure to complete the assigned work will result in the I being counted as an IC,\n                  or failing grade for grade point average computation. An I grade not made up within\n                  one calendar year after the grade has been recorded is changed to an IC (or an NC\n                  if CR/NC grading was approved). Incomplete grades must be cleared before a degree is awarded. In the absence of the\n                  instructor who has assigned the incomplete, a student seeking to make up this grade\n                  should consult the department chair. A short-term extension of time may be granted with justification by contacting the\n                  Office of the University Registrar prior to the last day of the second semester/session. Report in Progress (RP). The \"RP\" symbol is used in connection with courses that extend beyond one academic\n                  term. It indicates that work is in progress but that assignment of a final grade must\n                  await completion of additional work. Work is to be completed within one year except\n                  for graduate degree theses. The RP may be used only in courses designated on the approved\n                  RP grade course list published by the Office of the Provost and Vice President for\n                  Academic Affairs. Cumulative enrollment in units attempted may not exceed the total\n                  number applicable to the student's educational objective. While completing work on an RP or an I, graduate students are required to be continuously\n                  enrolled at California State University, Fresno, every semester until the awarding\n                  of the degree. Graduate students enrolled in Project (298) or Thesis (299) receive\n                  RP grades at the end of the first semester of enrollment and are advised to complete\n                  work on the culminating experience during four additional semesters, subject to the\n                  five-year overall time limit for completion of all master's degree requirements. In\n                  addition, if an RP in 298 or 299 is not replaced by a final grade within two years\n                  as recommended, the student's major department may require him or her to re-register\n                  for the course. (Search Graduate Studies.) Withdrawal Unauthorized (WU). The symbol WU indicates that an enrolled student did not withdraw from the course\n                  and also failed to complete course requirements. It is used when, in the opinion of\n                  the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient\n                  to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. For purposes of grade\n                  point average and progress point computation this symbol is equivalent to an F. In\n                  instances where a course is graded CR/NC or the student elects a CR/NC grading option,\n                  the WU grade will be converted to NC. Withdrawal (W). The W symbol indicates that the student was permitted to drop the course after the\n                  fourth week of instruction for serious and compelling reasons with the approval of\n                  the instructor and appropriate campus officials. It carries no connotation of quality\n                  of student performance and is not used in calculating grade point average. Undergraduate\n                  students may withdraw from no more than 18 semester units. Grade Symbols and Grade Points A - Excellent. Performance of the student has demonstrated the highest level of competence, showing\n                  sustained superiority in meeting all stated course objectives and responsibilities\n                  and exhibiting a very high degree of intellectual initiative. (4 grade points per\n                  unit.) B - Very Good. ( 1 ) Performance of the student has demonstrated a high level of competence, showing\n                  sustained superiority in meeting all stated course objectives and responsibilities\n                  and exhibiting a high degree of intellectual initiative. (3 grade points per unit.) C - Satisfactory. ( 2 ) Performance of the student has demonstrated a satisfactory level of competence,\n                  showing an adequate level of understanding of course objectives, responsibilities,\n                  and comprehension of course intent. (2 grade points per unit.) D - Unsatisfactory. ( 2,3 ) Performance of the student has been unsatisfactory, showing inadequacy in meeting\n                  basic course objectives, responsibilities, and comprehension of course content. (1\n                  grade point per unit.) F - Failure. Fails to meet course objectives. Work at this level does not meet requirements for\n                  credit toward a degree. (0 grade points per unit.) WU - Failure Withdrawal Unauthorized. ( 4 ) The symbol WU indicates that an enrolled student did not withdraw from the course\n                  and also failed to complete course requirements. It is assigned when, in the opinion\n                  of the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient\n                  to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. For purposes of grade\n                  point average and progress point computation this symbol is equivalent to an F.  (0\n                  grade points per unit.) CR - Credit for units allowed, work of A, B, or C quality in undergraduate courses and\n                  A or B quality in 200-level courses. (0 grade points per unit; units allowed for the\n                  degree.) NC - No credit for units registered for, work of D or F quality in undergraduate courses\n                  and C, D, or F quality in 200-level courses. Replaces I grade in courses where CR/NC\n                  grading is used if required work is not completed within required time. (0 grade points\n                  per unit; no units allowed for the degree.) W - Withdrawal after the fourth week of instruction. (Not used in grade point calculation.) I - Incomplete Authorized. Required coursework has not been completed and evaluated yet. (Not used in grade\n                  point calculation.) See Incomplete Grade Explanation which follows. IC - Incomplete Charged . Student who received an authorized Incomplete (I) did not complete the required\n                  coursework within the allowed time limit (0 grade points per unit). RD - Report delayed. Grade must be cleared before a degree is awarded. (Not used in grade point calculation.) RP - Report in Progress. Continuing work in progress. (No units allowed and not included in grade point calculation\n                  until grade is assigned.) AU - Audit. Grade indicates student's status as auditor and does not earn degree credit. ___________________ Master's degree candidates are reminded that a B (3.0) average is required in the\n                     master's degree program and for all courses (related and unrelated; lower division,\n                     upper division, and graduate) taken concurrently with the master's degree program. Undergraduate students are reminded that a C (2.0) average is required for all college\n                     coursework completed, all courses taken at California State University, Fresno, and\n                     all courses in the major in order to graduate with a baccalaureate degree. Some majors\n                     are subject to more stringent grading requirements. Master's degree candidates are reminded that a D is not accepted toward any master's\n                     degree program. A WU is assigned only for courses graded A through F. The course can be repeated and\n                     the new grade may be substituted for the WU by petition, except for master's degree\n                     students. (See Repeating Courses .) Grading Policies and Practices Grading. Students are expected to complete all requirements for a class by the end of the\n                  semester unless an incomplete is permitted by the instructor in accordance with university\n                  policy. Students shall not be assigned additional work or be allowed to revise previous\n                  assignments in order to improve a final grade. College Syllabus and Record Keeping. All faculty members shall provide students at the beginning of each semester a syllabus\n                  or outline stating course goals and objectives including grading methodology, types\n                  and number of projects, written assignments, tests, experiments, etc. Dean's List and President's List. Undergraduate students enrolled in at least 12 letter-graded units* during a regular\n                  matriculated term, earning no grade lower than a C, and earning at least a 3.5* grade\n                  point average (GPA) for the term are placed on the Dean's List for that term and a\n                  note is added to their transcript. Students meeting these requirements and having\n                  a 4.0* GPA for the term are placed on the President's List. * Excludes CR/NC and remedial/college readiness coursework. Repeating Courses . Undergraduate students may register for courses a second time only if they earned a grade of D, F, IC, or WU during the first attempt and they have\n                  not exceeded 28 units of repeated coursework. Topics courses with the same title and\n                  description are not repeatable for additional credit. Undergraduate students may not register to take a course more than two times until\n                  they complete the required paperwork, meet with a major advisor, obtain verification\n                  of all of the following conditions, and submit the verification to the major department\n                  chair for approval: they have not exceeded 28 units of repeated coursework, they received a grade of D, F, IC, or WU upon the second attempt of the course, the course to be repeated is a program requirement, the program they are pursuing requires a grade of C or higher in the course to fulfill\n                     a program requirement, and there are no other courses in the catalog that can be used to fulfill the program\n                     requirement. The chair will not grant this approval unless all of these conditions are met. If the request is approved, the student submits the required paperwork. Grade Substitution by Repetition of Courses. An undergraduate student may grade substitute up to 16 semester units of undergraduate\n                  coursework at California State University, Fresno. If the original grade was D, F,\n                  WU, or IC, and the subsequent grade is the same or higher, the new grade will be substituted\n                  for the original grade. Only the substituted grade will be used in determining the\n                  student's grade point average. Grade substitution can be used only once for an individual\n                  course. If the original grade was C, CR, or better, the course cannot be repeated.\n                  A student may repeat a total of 28 units, 16 of which may be used for grade substitution,\n                  as described above, and 12 units of which can be averaged. Grade forgiveness shall not be applicable to courses for which the original grade\n                  was the result of a finding of academic dishonesty (excerpt from EO 1037). A course in which a grade of NC was earned may be repeated but since the NC grade\n                  does not affect the grade point average, no substitution is necessary; however, the\n                  repeat will count toward the 12 unit limitation of averaged units. A course attempted at another institution may be eligible for grade substitution by\n                  repeating a regular California State University, Fresno course determined to be equivalent\n                  and articulated. A course for which grade substitution has been granted at another\n                  institution may not be repeated for grade substitution at California State University,\n                  Fresno. In addition, a course taken at California State University, Fresno may not be repeated\n                     for grade substitution at another institution. Postbaccalaureate students pursuing (1) a second baccalaureate degree, (2) a teaching\n                  credential, or (3) no specific objective, are also free to repeat a course and request\n                  grade substitution on the same basis as undergraduates provided the original course\n                  was completed when the student had postbaccalaureate standing. Postbaccalaureate students pursuing a doctoral degree, master's degree, or certificate\n                  of advanced study may, with approval of an advisor, repeat a course for academic credit,\n                  regardless of what grade was originally earned in the course. However, the student\n                  is not eligible to petition for grade substitution. All course work taken, beginning\n                  with the first term of the student's doctoral or master's degree program, is used\n                  in determining the student's grade point average and graduation eligibility. All appropriate grade substitutions will automatically be posted to the student’s\n                  records at the end of each semester except in cases in which the first attempt was\n                  at another institution. For these cases, contact the Office of the University Registrar\n                  by the last day of the semester. For further information, contact the Student Services Center located in the North\n                  Lobby, Joyal Administration Building. Academic Renewal. Under certain circumstances, the university may disregard up to two semesters (three\n                  quarters) of previous undergraduate coursework taken at California State University,\n                  Fresno or at any other college from all considerations associated with requirements\n                  for the baccalaureate degree. When such action is approved, the student's permanent\n                  academic record is marked to indicate that no work taken during the disregarded term(s), even if satisfactory, may apply toward\n                  baccalaureate requirements. However, all work must remain legible on the record ensuring\n                  a true and complete academic history. In order to qualify for renewal, all of the following conditions must be met: Five years must have elapsed since the most recent work to be disregarded was completed. It must be evident that the poor level of work represented by the term(s) under consideration\n                     is not representative (see No. 3) of the student's usual academic performance and\n                     was due to extenuating circumstances. The student must have completed the following in residence at California State University,\n                     Fresno since the most recent work to be disregarded was completed: (a.) 15 semester\n                     units with at least a 3.0 GPA or ( b.) 30 semester units with at least a 2.5 GPA or\n                     ( c.) 45 semester units with a 2.0 GPA. Work completed at another institution cannot\n                     be used to satisfy this request. It must be evident that it would be necessary for the student to complete one or more\n                     additional terms in order to qualify for the baccalaureate degree if the request were\n                     not approved, i.e., that the student would have less than a 2.0 grade point average\n                     in one or more of the following: (a) Cumulative collegiate coursework (b) All California\n                     State University, Fresno coursework (c) Coursework required for the major This policy may not be used in concert with any other academic forgiveness policy\n                     impacting particular academic term(s). For further information or to apply for academic renewal, contact the Undergraduate\n                  Degree Evaluations, 559.278.4076. Leave of Absence. A leave of absence is defined as a planned interruption or pause in a student’s regular\n                  academic attendance. In effect, the student temporarily ceases formal studies at California\n                  State University, Fresno, while pursuing other activities that may assist in clarifying\n                  and/or contributing to educational goals. It may also involve a military or medical\n                  leave. The intent of the policy is to make it possible for a student to suspend his\n                  or her academic work, leave the campus without jeopardizing rights and privileges,\n                  and later resume studies with a minimum of procedural difficulty. A student who is approved for a Leave of Absence will be considered a continuing Fresno\n                  State student and will maintain “catalog rights”.  If the student registers at Fresno\n                  State at the conclusion of the granted leave, (an) application for readmission will\n                  not be required. A planned educational leave for graduate students must be recommended by the Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies, Frank W. Thomas Building, Room 130 and requires\n                  an additional signature of your Graduate Program Coordinator. The following regulations apply to a leave of absence: Eligible students must have completed at least one semester at Fresno State and be\n                     in good academic standing. Leave of Absences are granted for two to four consecutive semesters only. Exception:\n                     Military active duty orders are extended for the duration of the orders as noted. In addition to recommendation by a faculty advisor and a chair, international students\n                     must be recommended by an advisor of international student services and programs,\n                     and educational opportunity program students by an EOP counselor. If you are requesting\n                     a military leave, an additional signature is required from the Veterans Resource Center. Petitions for leave of absence must be filed (with the appropriate recommendation)\n                     at the Registrar’s Office before the first day of classes for the semester during\n                     which the leave is to begin. Leaves are not approved for students dismissed due to academic deficiencies or disciplinary\n                     actions are not eligible for leaves of absence. A leave is not approved if the student plans to attend another institution, unless\n                     the coursework the student seeks is not available at California State University,\n                     Fresno. Any academic credit earned while on a planned educational leave is accredited\n                     by California State University, Fresno only if permission is granted for that credit\n                     in advance. Students who do not return to the university at the conclusion of their leave of absence\n                     and those who enroll elsewhere will be considered to have withdrawn from the university\n                     at the end of their last semester of regular enrollment at California State University,\n                     Fresno and will have to reapply for admission upon their return. Students wishing to apply for a Leave of Absence should obtain an online form from\n                  the Registrar Office website. Please review the form for required documentation before\n                  submission. Students will be notified by Fresno State email with a decision and may\n                  be asked for additional information. Student Academic Petitions. The Student Academic Petitions Committee has the authority to permit exceptions to\n                  university baccalaureate degree requirements when fulfilling the degree requirement\n                  would prove to be an undue hardship for the student and/or such an exception can be\n                  demonstrated to be educationally justifiable. The committee will take action only\n                  upon the submission of a formal petition by the student that sets forth the facts\n                  and circumstances that may warrant special consideration. Petitions and procedural information are available in the University Advising Center.\n                  The Petitions Committee does not make decisions pertaining to substitutions for undergraduate and graduate major requirements.\n                  Such requests are initiated through the student's department. Requests to waive established\n                  university policy governing graduate study may be addressed to the dean, Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies. If a request cannot be accommodated, it is forwarded\n                  to the Graduate Committee. Contact University Advising Center for further assistance with student academic petitions. Grade Protests. The Student Academic Petitions Committee also has the responsibility of handling\n                  grade protests for all students, undergraduate and postbaccalaureate. Students who\n                  believe they have been graded unfairly or incorrectly by an instructor must consult\n                  first with the faculty member concerned within the first 15 working days of the following\n                  semester and make every effort to resolve the issue. The instructor has five working\n                  days to respond. For cases in which an incorrect grade was assigned due to a recording\n                  error, the instructor will submit a Grade Correction Request form to the Office of\n                  the University Registrar. If the issue is not resolved, a student must immediately consult with the department\n                  chair, who will give the student an answer within 10 working days. If a student still\n                  believes that the grade was assigned unfairly or incorrectly after completing this\n                  process, the student then may request that the Student Academic Petitions Committee\n                  review the issue. To request review, students must immediately make an appointment\n                  with an academic counselor in the University Advising Center (Joyal, Rm. 224; 559.278.1787)\n                  to discuss their particular situation and to receive a copy of the university's grade\n                  protest policy as well as additional procedural instructions. Students then must submit a written statement no later than midsemester setting forth\n                  all pertinent details to the chair of the Petitions Committee. Readmission of Disqualified Students, Undergraduate and Graduate Undergraduate . Disqualified students who have not attended for more than two semesters must submit\n                  an application for readmission to the university and the appropriate readmission petition.\n                  Readmission occurs for fall semesters only. Prospective students can apply through\n                  CalStateApply between October 1 - January 17 for the following fall semester. Contact 559.278.2261 for more information. Postbaccalaureate/Graduate . To be considered for readmission to the university after disqualification, graduate\n                  and advanced certificate students must submit a “Petition for Readmission of Disqualified\n                  Graduate or Advanced Certificate Student” form to their graduate (or advanced certificate)\n                  program coordinator. Petitions are available online at https://academics.fresnostate.edu/drgs/gradstudies/forms/index.html . Disqualified graduate (or advanced certificate) students who petition for readmission\n                  AFTER having been out of attendance for a semester or more, must also reapply for\n                  admission through Cal State Apply. Additionally, students who seek a second baccalaureate\n                  or credential are asked to obtain the recommendation of the department/program to\n                  which they seek readmission. Students who are undeclared must have the approval of\n                  the dean of Division of Research and Graduate Studies to be readmitted to the university. Student Absences Students are expected to attend class and should maintain contact with their faculty\n                  members regarding any absences. Individual faculty members should be contacted when\n                  there are extended absences (more than one week) due to illness, death in the immediate\n                  family, or other situations. In urgent or extraordinary emergencies that preclude\n                  direct contact with individual faculty, students may contact the Office of the Vice\n                  President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at 559.278.2541. Any make-up\n                  work or missed assignments remain the responsibility of the student. Transcript Evaluation Undergraduate transfer students are usually evaluated under the degree requirements\n                  listed in the General Catalog at the time they enter California State University,\n                  Fresno. Transfer students who accept their admission offer and register for a mandatory Dog\n                  Days session should receive an email with instructions on how to access their computerized\n                  evaluation (DPR - Degree Progress Report). The DPR provides detail regarding the acceptance\n                  and processing of transfer coursework and also indicates remaining degree requirements.\n                  It is recommended that students access their DPR through self-service at least once\n                  a semester and review it with their academic advisor. A degree evaluation is completed\n                  during the semester a student files for graduation. (See Graduation and Commencement.) All official transcripts submitted by the student either in support of an application\n                  for admission or for degree completion become the property of California State University,\n                  Fresno and are not returned to the student. Students are strongly encouraged to obtain\n                  duplicate copies of their records from high school and colleges previously attended\n                  for their personal file. Transcripts and Grade Reports Transcript of Record. Students may request transcripts of their academic records at California State University,\n                  Fresno. Transcripts are not provided to students with administrative holds as determined\n                  by university officials. Transcripts of records from other institutions submitted to California State University,\n                     Fresno are not returned to students. For more information on how to order, visit www.fresnostate.edu/transcripts . Grade Reports to Students. Students may obtain their grades via the Student Center systems at the end of each\n                  regular semester by the grading deadline.

It\n                        provides students with a foundation in the liberal arts and sciences and prepares\n                        them for specialized study in a particular discipline or program. The overall objective of General Education is to create a context wherein basic skills\n                        are developed and strengthened, scholarship and disciplined thinking emerge, awareness\n                        and reflection occur, and ultimately - the integration of knowledge begins. In the 2021-2022 academic year, Area F - Ethnic Studies was added to the General Education\n                        Breadth program per EO1100. Along with this update, American Government has been changed to a University requirement (see ‘Specific Course/Skill Requirements’\n                        on the Regulation page for details). Effective fall 2021, the new General Education\n                        program will be in place. Students who fall under earlier catalog years follow the\n                        General Education requirements as their catalog year specifies. In the 2018-2019 academic year, the university conducted a major revision of the General\n                        Education program per EO1100-revised. All students enrolling in the university as\n                        first-time freshmen beginning fall 2018 and after, and all transfer students entering\n                        fall 2018 or after who elect to adopt the 2018-2019 catalog, will be required to complete\n                        this new General Education Program. Students who fall under earlier catalog years\n                        follow the 1999-2000 General Education requirements. All freshmen and transfer students admitted to Fresno State for the first time in\n                        Fall 2018 and later are required to submit assignments and reflections to the G.E.\n                        Program ePortfolio as part of their G.E. requirements. Additional information about\n                        the specific requirements for freshmen and transfer students (which are different)\n                        can be found in a Canvas course and within the G.E. Program ePortfolio in which students\n                        are automatically enrolled. Students admitted prior to Fall 2018, even if they are\n                        readmitted after Fall 2018, are not required to complete a G.E. Program ePortfolio. Foundation, Breadth, and Integration The General Education Program is an integrated curriculum of courses organized into\n                        four groups: Lower-Division FOUNDATION , the basic foundation of one's university education, consists of courses in fundamental\n                        skills and knowledge. Purpose: An educated person must be able to read critically, communicate effectively, and\n                           think clearly. BREADTH exposes students to a variety of disciplines within a structured framework that develops\n                        knowledge in four basic areas of human endeavor. Area B (Physical Science) – Purpose: To understand and actively explore fundamental principles in the Physical Sciences\n                           and the methods of developing and testing hypotheses used in the analysis of the physical\n                           universe. Area B (Life Science) – Purpose: To understand basic concepts of living things, the nature of scientific knowledge,\n                           and the relevance of biological knowledge to human affairs. Area C (Arts) – Purpose: To develop an appreciation and understanding of and to stimulate imagination and\n                           creativity through study and participation in art, dance, music, and theatre. Area C (Humanities) – Purpose: Through the study of the humanities, to understand, appreciate, and analyze the meaning\n                           of our civilization, its cultural background, and the nature and role of language.\n                           To study the humanities from a variety of historical perspectives and cultures by\n                           analyzing individual works. Area D (Social, Political, and Economic Institutions and Behavior, Historical Background)\n                        – Purpose: To understand and analyze the basic principles underlying human social behavior. Area E (Lifelong Understanding and Self-Development) – Purpose: To equip human beings for lifelong understanding and development of themselves as\n                           integrated physiological and psychological entities. Area F (Ethnic Studies) - Purpose: Ethnic Studies is the interdisciplinary and comparative study of race and ethnicity\n                           with special focus on four historically defined racialized core groups: Native Americans,\n                           African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latina and Latino Americans. Upper-Division INTEGRATION ties together the Program by providing an integrative experience at the upper-division\n                        level in three areas of breadth. All courses are upper-division. Purpose: The Integration component of General Education is included to provide instruction at the upper division\n                           level that integrates material from each of the BREADTH areas B and C. Requirements The General Education Program requires students to complete a minimum of 48 semester\n                        units. All requirements must be met with courses of at least three semester units.\n                        The requirements include: four courses in FOUNDATION, nine courses in BREADTH, and\n                        three upper-division INTEGRATION courses. These three upper-division courses should\n                        be taken no sooner than the term in which 60 units of college coursework are completed.\n                        A minimum of 9 units of coursework for General Education must be taken in residence\n                        (see Residence Requirements ) at California State University, Fresno. Because the goal of General Education is to provide a solid foundation with a broad\n                        scope and the goal of the major is to provide depth in a specific discipline or program,\n                        the following stipulations apply: Foundation courses must be completed with a grade of C or better to satisfy the General Education\n                           requirement. A maximum of two General Education courses from one department or program may be applied\n                           to satisfy Breadth requirements. Beginning in fall 2021, courses in GE Area D shall be completed in at least two different\n                           disciplines among the nine units required in Area D1, D2, and ID. Writing in General Education Courses The university's General Education Program requires that almost all courses in the\n                        program have substantial iterative writing assignments. All Foundation courses except those in Quantitative Methods (B4) and all Breadth courses\n                        will require iterative writing assignments totaling at least 1,000 words. All upper-division courses (IB, IC, and ID) will require iterative writing assignments\n                        totaling at least 2,000 words.

Thomas Building 107 559.278.7079 Chris Fiorentino, Director https://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/cesl/ California State University, Fresno has a rich history of engaging students in service\n                  to the community. As part of an overall educational experience, community engagement\n                  can have a profound impact on a student’s personal, professional, and academic development.\n                  During the 2018-2019 academic year, the university provided over 1.4 million hours\n                  of service to the community. Mission The Jan and Bud Richter Center for Community Engagement and Service-Learning is responsible\n                  for coordinating the university’s community engagement and service-learning efforts. \n                  We are dedicated to improving the education and development of our students and helping\n                  create a better community through service and learning. Community Engagement Fresno State is committed to being a premiere university that is fully engaged with\n                  our community. This is reflected in the many ways our university demonstrates, through\n                  mutually beneficial partnerships, the alignment between the university’s teaching,\n                  research, and professional service and the interests of our region. Examples of community\n                  engagement activities include, but are not limited to, volunteerism; service-learning;\n                  applied research; efforts that engage the campus community in the democratic process;\n                  faculty and staff professional service to the community; and projects that address\n                  the historical, cultural, and/or informational needs of the region. Service-Learning Service-learning is proven to enhance students’ academic success, career development,\n                  and personal skills. This is accomplished through active participation in meaningful\n                  service linked to academic study through structured reflection. The service may include\n                  improvement of community resources, direct service to people in need, applied research,\n                  community outreach and education, or policy analysis and advocacy.  There approximately\n                  4,000 students enrolled in nearly 200 such courses offered each year at Fresno State.\n                  Approved service-learning courses are listed in the catalog and the Class Schedule\n                  with an “S” designation. Additional details can be found at www.fresnostate.edu/cesl . To promote the value of service activities and enhance the subsequent learning experience,\n                  the university also offers two community service-learning courses for academic credit. COMS 1. Community Service-Learning COMS 101I. Community Service Internship Note : Students are required to complete a minimum number of service hours with a nonprofit\n                  agency of their choice. The required number of service hours is determined by the\n                  course and number of COMS units. For more information, contact the Richter Center\n                  staff or visit the Web page at www.fresnostate.edu/cesl Who Benefits? Everyone! Research has shown that students who are involved in community service activities\n                  during their undergraduate years significantly enhance many aspects of their personal,\n                  professional, and academic development. Programs and citizens of our community dramatically\n                  benefit from the service work of students. Community service and service-learning\n                  provide an opportunity for everyone to gain important benefits.

For more, see the following: Undergraduate: https://www.fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/advising/students/probation-disqualification/index.html Graduate: http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/gradstudies/requirements/requiredgpa.html Bachelor's/Master's/Doctoral Degrees California State University, Fresno is authorized to grant the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor\n                  of Science, Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Biotechnology, Master of\n                  Business Administration, Master of Fine Arts, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Master of\n                  Public Administration, Master of Public Health, and Master of Social Work degrees.\n                  California State University, Fresno offers an Educational Specialist degree (Ed.S.)\n                  in School Psychology, a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT.) in Physical Therapy, and\n                  a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). California State University, Fresno also offers\n                  a doctoral degree (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership. See Kremen School of Education and Human Development for public school credentials for which the university is authorized to recommend\n                  candidates. Choice of Catalog Election of Regulations. An undergraduate student or postbaccalaureate student pursuing a second bachelor’s\n                  degree must fulfill degree requirements from one catalog, not the most favorable requirements\n                  from two or more catalogs. As long as a student maintains “continuous attendance,”\n                  he or she may elect, for purposes of fulfilling graduation requirements, one of the\n                  following: The catalog in effect at the time a student enters a California community college\n                     or a campus of the California State University system. The catalog in effect at the time a student enters California State University, Fresno. The catalog in effect at the time the student applies to graduate from California\n                     State University, Fresno. Continuous attendance is defined as being officially enrolled at least one semester\n                  or two quarters during a calendar year. Students must demonstrate progress toward\n                  fulfillment of degree requirements to maintain registration eligibility as a continuing\n                  student. A student may not begin “continuous attendance” while still enrolled in high\n                  school. Once a student establishes catalog rights in the CSU or California Community College\n                  system, he or she may attend any accredited college or university (outside the CSU\n                  and California Community College system) or take a planned educational leave for no\n                  more than two years and maintain his or her continuous attendance status. (See Leave of Absence .) Any break in attendance of one calendar year or longer ends a student's continuous\n                  attendance status. This results in the loss of catalog rights to all catalog choices\n                  prior to the break in attendance. It should be noted that enrollment in Open University,\n                  extension, and correspondence courses does not establish catalog rights nor contribute\n                  toward continuous attendance to maintain catalog rights. A loss of catalog rights\n                  could result in one or more additional semesters to meet new catalog requirements\n                  especially in the major and/or General Education. Once a student graduates, however,\n                  all rights to the original catalog are terminated. Graduate (master's) students fulfill requirements based on an approved advancement\n                  to candidacy petition. These requirements are based on departmental and university\n                  requirements as published in the current catalog at the time of advancement. Continuous\n                  enrollment is likewise defined differently for master's students. (Search Graduate\n                  Studies.) Computer Requirement At Fresno State, computers and communications links to remote resources are recognized\n                  as being integral to the education and research experience. Every student is required\n                  to have his/her own computer or other personal access to a device with all the recommended\n                  software. The recommended standards for devices and software, which may vary by academic\n                  major, are updated periodically and are available from the Kennel Bookstore. The university\n                  provides students access to some software free of charge or at reduced rates. Faculty will presume that students have 24-hour\n                  access to a device and the necessary communication links to the University's information\n                  resources. Fresno State maintains a limited number of workstations in various labs\n                  and laptops for checkout to facilitate this access. It also provides a Wi-Fi network\n                  on campus for access to the Internet. Definition of Key Terms Additional Requirements. Courses from one or more departments or programs that are required in support of\n                  the major. Such courses are not included in the minimum 2.0 grade point average required\n                  in the major for graduation and may be waived or substituted at the discretion of\n                  the major department or program. Additional requirements normally may be applied toward\n                  a minor. Additional requirements may also be applied toward General Education unless\n                  specifically prohibited by the major department. Certificate . A set of interdisciplinary courses comprising of a minimum of 12 units focusing\n                  on a special area of study. Students are not required to be matriculated or be undergraduates.\n                  Certificates are awarded upon completion of the program regardless of catalog year\n                  or degree status. The university awards three types of certificates. They include\n                  the Certificate of Completion, the Certificate of Special Study, and the Certificate\n                  of Advanced Study. See Certificates in Degree Requirements for more information. The Certificate of Completion is awarded for successfully completing a planned educational experience designed\n                     for specific academic objectives. The Certificate of Special Study is awarded for successfully completing a structured program of educational experiences\n                        of at least twelve semester units, determined in advance by a department or school,\n                        and consisting of upper division (100-199) courses, professional (300-399) courses,\n                        and related activities. Certificate of Advanced Study . A certificate program of special study at the postbaccalaureate level. Concurrent Enrollment. The term concurrent enrollment is used to describe several different types of enrollment: Open University Enrollment. Nonmatriculated students may enroll in regular California State University, Fresno\n                     classes through Continuing and Global Education. Concurrent Enrollment at Other CSU Campuses. CSU students may attend two CSU campuses simultaneously. This type of enrollment\n                     is not often used by California State University, Fresno students because of the distance\n                     to other CSU campuses. (See the registration section for details.) Concurrent Enrollment at a Non-CSU College or University. While enrolled at California State University, Fresno, students may enroll for additional\n                     courses at another institution outside the CSU system. The course load in the combined\n                     enrollment program may not exceed the maximum unit load restrictions for California\n                     State University, Fresno. (See the registration section for details.) Core. A common set of courses within a major or minor that all students are required to\n                  complete. Degree Progress Report (DPR) . The DPR is a tool used by students and advisors to guide the advising process. Students\n                  may print their own DPR through self-service in the student portal, My Fresno State.\n                  The DPR shows the student’s progress in a chosen degree program, incorporating courses\n                  completed at California State University, Fresno and transfer institutions. The DPR\n                  illustrates how courses apply toward the student’s declared major, General Education,\n                  and degree requirements. It also displays a list of approved courses for each requirement\n                  to be completed. Double-Counting. Allowing one course to fulfill two separate requirements concurrently; e.g., allowing\n                  one course to fulfill both a major requirement and the upper-division writing skills\n                  requirement, or allowing one course to fulfill both a major requirement and General\n                  Education requirement. Electives. Courses/units a student selects to complete the total unit requirement for the baccalaureate\n                  degree and/or to complete requirements for the major. Grade Point Average (GPA). The grade point average is a measure of academic scholarship and performance which\n                  is computed by dividing units attempted into grade points earned. Three separate GPAs\n                  are computed: Cumulative GPA for all baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate units by degree objective. Cumulative GPA for total California State University, Fresno units. GPA for that semester only. A minimum of a C average (2.0 GPA) for units in the major, all California State University, Fresno\n                  units, and total units is required for a baccalaureate degree. (Search for Grade Symbols\n                  and Grade Points, Degree Requirements.) Master's degree students have a higher minimum\n                  GPA requirement. (Search for Graduate Studies Advancement to Candidacy, Grade Requirements.) Major. Set of required courses from one or more departments designed to provide students\n                  with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to pursue a specific career\n                  and/or advanced study. A student must earn a 2.0 grade point average in all courses\n                  required for the major, except \"additional requirements,\" in order to graduate. (Minimum\n                  Title 5 requirements: B.A. 24 units of which 12 must be upper division exclusive of\n                  General Education; B.S. 36 units of which 18 must be upper division exclusive of General\n                  Education.) Minor. In addition to academic majors, the university offers a number of minors. A minor\n                  is a formal set of courses in a designated subject area distinct from a student's\n                  major. The intent of a minor is to provide a condensed and cohesive academic experience,\n                  in addition to a major. Minors consist of a minimum of 12 semester units, at least\n                  6 of which must be upper-division residence units. Minors must be completed with a\n                  minimum GPA of 2.0. Minors offered by academic departments and programs are listed\n                  in the minors section of the catalog. Detailed descriptions are found in the listings of the particular\n                  departments and programs. Courses in the minor may not also count toward a student's\n                  major except as Additional Requirements to that major. However, courses fulfilling\n                  requirements for a minor usually may be counted toward General Education. Refer to\n                  the description of the specific minor for exceptions. A student may earn a maximum of two minors provided that the requirements above are\n                  met for each and that at least 12 units in each of the two minors are distinct and\n                  include at least 6 upper-division units in residence. Minors will not appear on a\n                  diploma. My Degree Plan . My Degree Plan is an interactive planning tool students may use to plan courses\n                  for future semesters. It allows students to validate their plan against the DPR or\n                  Roadmap to ensure efficient planning towards meeting graduation requirements. Option. Set of required courses within a major in addition to the major core courses that\n                  emphasizes one important aspect of that school or college, department, or program.\n                  The option in a major will appear on a diploma. Emphasis . Set of required courses that focuses on a specific area within a major. An emphasis\n                  or area of emphasis does not appear on the diploma or the official transcript. Prerequisite Requirements. Prerequisite courses must be completed prior to enrollment in the listed course;\n                  corequisite courses must be completed prior to or concurrently with the listed course.\n                  Students who do not meet these requirements may be disenrolled by the instructor or\n                  by the university. Recommended Courses. Courses that the department faculty believe would be beneficial for a student to\n                  take but are not mandated or required as part of the major. Roadmap. The Roadmap is a planning tool designed to assist students and advisors in developing\n                  a course scheduling strategy to maximize potential. Roadmaps provide students with\n                  the best recommended sequence of courses for success, and ultimately, degree completion. Units. A credit or semester unit represents one hour of class work per week for one semester.\n                  It is assumed that two hours of preparation are required for each hour in class. Three\n                  hours of laboratory per week is the equivalent of one unit. In a limited number of\n                  courses two hours of laboratory per week are the equivalent of one unit. Also, two\n                  hours of activity or studio (art, dance, music, physical education) are normally equivalent\n                  to one unit of credit. One quarter unit of credit is equivalent to two-thirds of a\n                  semester unit. Units Attempted (UA) and Units Earned (UE) are terms that appear on the student’s\n                  transcript and evaluation. Units attempted is the column used for GPA calculation.\n                  Units earned is the column used to determine units completed toward the total unit\n                  requirement for the degree. Dispute Resolution A student-related dispute could arise out of a decision or action in the course of\n                  official duty by a member of the faculty, staff, or administration of California State\n                  University, Fresno. The decision or action could be alleged as discriminatory, contrary\n                  to accepted academic relationships and procedures, or restrictive of the rights of\n                  any student of the university to fair treatment. The purpose of the dispute resolution\n                  process is to provide a mechanism for students to have a third party review the situation. The student must first make a good faith effort to resolve the matter informally by\n                  talking directly with the individual concerned, the individual's direct supervisor\n                  or department chair, and the director of the unit or college/school dean. If resolution\n                  is not effected through the informal procedures, for assistance students should contact\n                  the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. Enrollment in Graduate-level (200-297) Courses Enrollment in graduate-level (200-297) courses is limited to those who have been officially\n                  admitted to a graduate degree, advanced certificate, or credential program. However,\n                  there is a special program for last-semester undergraduate seniors who want to enroll\n                  in 200-level courses. All criteria listed on the Undergraduate Petition to Enroll\n                  in Graduate (200-level) Courses must be met. This petition, available from the Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies, should be filed prior to the semester in which the\n                  student desires enrollment in 200-level course(s). Explanation of Grades Audit Status (AU). Auditors must submit the Audit Grading Option Form no later than the 20th day of\n                  instruction in which you are taking the course. Audit grading basis option IS NOT\n                  available through the Student Portal registration system. Review the information and\n                  regulations for Audit below before completing the required form. Enrollment as an auditor is subject to permission of the instructor. Enrollment in\n                  a course as an auditor shall be permitted only after students otherwise eligible to\n                  enroll on a credit basis have had an opportunity to do so. Auditors are subject to\n                  the same fee structure as credit students and regular class attendance is expected.\n                  Once enrolled as an auditor, a student may not change to credit status unless such\n                  a change is requested no later than the last day to add classes (20th day of instruction)\n                  in that term. A student who is enrolled for credit may not change to audit status\n                  after the fourth week of instruction. Regular class attendance is expected and the student may be required to participate\n                  in any or all classroom activities at the discretion of the instructor. Audit courses do not give students any degree credit and are not used in a master's\n                  program. Credit/No Credit Grading (CR/NC). The credit/no credit grading policy at California State University, Fresno is designed\n                  to encourage academic exploration outside the major field of study. The policy also\n                  recognizes that in certain types of courses, student performance is best evaluated\n                  in terms of credit/no credit grading rather than through the traditional letter grades. Neither the CR nor NC grade is included in the calculation of the grade point average.\n                  The grade of CR is assigned if the student's work is judged to be equivalent to an\n                  A, B, or C grade as applicable to regular enrollment in an undergraduate course or\n                  equivalent to an A or B grade in a 200-level course. The NC grade is assigned if the student's work is not equivalent to these standards: General conditions and limitations. Some courses are not available for CR/NC grading, (see individual course description),\n                     while others are designated as available for CR/NC grading only. All other courses\n                     are available for CR/NC grading; however, a student may not enroll in more than 6\n                     units of CR/NC graded coursework per semester. The decision to enroll for CR/NC grading\n                     must be made prior to the end of the fourth week of instruction and the decision must\n                     be recorded by the student by using the Web registration system. Undergraduate Students. A student may not elect CR/NC graded coursework to satisfy requirements for the major\n                     unless the courses have been designated CR/NC only. A maximum of 24 semester units\n                     at California State University, Fresno of CR/NC evaluated credit, including all coursework\n                     taken CR/NC only, may be applied toward the degree. Graduate Students . Credit for coursework earned through CR/NC in fall 1978 and in subsequent semesters\n                        may not be applied toward the master's degree unless the course has been designated\n                        as available for CR/NC only by the Graduate Committee. A maximum of 6 units of CR/NC\n                        only credit may be applied to a 30-unit master's degree program and a maximum of 12\n                        units of CR/NC only credit may be applied to a 60-unit program. Incomplete (I). The symbol I (Incomplete Authorized) indicates that a portion of required coursework\n                  has not been completed and evaluated in the prescribed time period due to unforeseen\n                  - but fully justified - reasons, and that there is still a possibility of earning\n                  credit. Such reasons must meet the criteria of serious and compelling and occur late\n                  in the semester. The grade of I is only appropriate when the student requesting it\n                  has completed a minimum of two-thirds of the work for the course with a passing grade.\n                  The instructor of record retains the right to decide whether or not an I grade is\n                  appropriate. It is the responsibility of the student to bring pertinent information\n                  to the attention of the instructor and to determine from the instructor the remaining\n                  course requirements that must be satisfied to remove the incomplete. The faculty member\n                  should complete the online incomplete contract detailing the work that needs to be\n                  completed. A final grade is assigned when the work agreed upon has been completed\n                  and evaluated. Students may not enroll in a course for which they have an I grade. Normally it is expected that the student will make up an I grade during the next semester;\n                  however, it must be made up within one calendar year immediately following the last\n                  day of the semester/session during which it was assigned. This limitation prevails\n                  whether or not the student maintains continuous enrollment. Failure to complete the assigned work will result in the I being counted as an IC,\n                  or failing grade for grade point average computation. An I grade not made up within\n                  one calendar year after the grade has been recorded is changed to an IC (or an NC\n                  if CR/NC grading was approved). Incomplete grades must be cleared before a degree is awarded. In the absence of the\n                  instructor who has assigned the incomplete, a student seeking to make up this grade\n                  should consult the department chair. A short-term extension of time may be granted with justification by contacting the\n                  Office of the University Registrar prior to the last day of the second semester/session. Report in Progress (RP). The \"RP\" symbol is used in connection with courses that extend beyond one academic\n                  term. It indicates that work is in progress but that assignment of a final grade must\n                  await completion of additional work. Work is to be completed within one year except\n                  for graduate degree theses. The RP may be used only in courses designated on the approved\n                  RP grade course list published by the Office of the Provost and Vice President for\n                  Academic Affairs. Cumulative enrollment in units attempted may not exceed the total\n                  number applicable to the student's educational objective. While completing work on an RP or an I, graduate students are required to be continuously\n                  enrolled at California State University, Fresno, every semester until the awarding\n                  of the degree. Graduate students enrolled in Project (298) or Thesis (299) receive\n                  RP grades at the end of the first semester of enrollment and are advised to complete\n                  work on the culminating experience during four additional semesters, subject to the\n                  five-year overall time limit for completion of all master's degree requirements. In\n                  addition, if an RP in 298 or 299 is not replaced by a final grade within two years\n                  as recommended, the student's major department may require him or her to re-register\n                  for the course. (Search Graduate Studies.) Withdrawal Unauthorized (WU). The symbol WU indicates that an enrolled student did not withdraw from the course\n                  and also failed to complete course requirements. It is used when, in the opinion of\n                  the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient\n                  to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. For purposes of grade\n                  point average and progress point computation this symbol is equivalent to an F. In\n                  instances where a course is graded CR/NC or the student elects a CR/NC grading option,\n                  the WU grade will be converted to NC. Withdrawal (W). The W symbol indicates that the student was permitted to drop the course after the\n                  fourth week of instruction for serious and compelling reasons with the approval of\n                  the instructor and appropriate campus officials. It carries no connotation of quality\n                  of student performance and is not used in calculating grade point average. Undergraduate\n                  students may withdraw from no more than 18 semester units. Grade Symbols and Grade Points A - Excellent. Performance of the student has demonstrated the highest level of competence, showing\n                  sustained superiority in meeting all stated course objectives and responsibilities\n                  and exhibiting a very high degree of intellectual initiative. (4 grade points per\n                  unit.) B - Very Good. ( 1 ) Performance of the student has demonstrated a high level of competence, showing\n                  sustained superiority in meeting all stated course objectives and responsibilities\n                  and exhibiting a high degree of intellectual initiative. (3 grade points per unit.) C - Satisfactory. ( 2 ) Performance of the student has demonstrated a satisfactory level of competence,\n                  showing an adequate level of understanding of course objectives, responsibilities,\n                  and comprehension of course intent. (2 grade points per unit.) D - Unsatisfactory. ( 2,3 ) Performance of the student has been unsatisfactory, showing inadequacy in meeting\n                  basic course objectives, responsibilities, and comprehension of course content. (1\n                  grade point per unit.) F - Failure. Fails to meet course objectives. Work at this level does not meet requirements for\n                  credit toward a degree. (0 grade points per unit.) WU - Failure Withdrawal Unauthorized. ( 4 ) The symbol WU indicates that an enrolled student did not withdraw from the course\n                  and also failed to complete course requirements. It is assigned when, in the opinion\n                  of the instructor, completed assignments or course activities or both were insufficient\n                  to make normal evaluation of academic performance possible. For purposes of grade\n                  point average and progress point computation this symbol is equivalent to an F.  (0\n                  grade points per unit.) CR - Credit for units allowed, work of A, B, or C quality in undergraduate courses and\n                  A or B quality in 200-level courses. (0 grade points per unit; units allowed for the\n                  degree.) NC - No credit for units registered for, work of D or F quality in undergraduate courses\n                  and C, D, or F quality in 200-level courses. Replaces I grade in courses where CR/NC\n                  grading is used if required work is not completed within required time. (0 grade points\n                  per unit; no units allowed for the degree.) W - Withdrawal after the fourth week of instruction. (Not used in grade point calculation.) I - Incomplete Authorized. Required coursework has not been completed and evaluated yet. (Not used in grade\n                  point calculation.) See Incomplete Grade Explanation which follows. IC - Incomplete Charged . Student who received an authorized Incomplete (I) did not complete the required\n                  coursework within the allowed time limit (0 grade points per unit). RD - Report delayed. Grade must be cleared before a degree is awarded. (Not used in grade point calculation.) RP - Report in Progress. Continuing work in progress. (No units allowed and not included in grade point calculation\n                  until grade is assigned.) AU - Audit. Grade indicates student's status as auditor and does not earn degree credit. ___________________ Master's degree candidates are reminded that a B (3.0) average is required in the\n                     master's degree program and for all courses (related and unrelated; lower division,\n                     upper division, and graduate) taken concurrently with the master's degree program. Undergraduate students are reminded that a C (2.0) average is required for all college\n                     coursework completed, all courses taken at California State University, Fresno, and\n                     all courses in the major in order to graduate with a baccalaureate degree. Some majors\n                     are subject to more stringent grading requirements. Master's degree candidates are reminded that a D is not accepted toward any master's\n                     degree program. A WU is assigned only for courses graded A through F. The course can be repeated and\n                     the new grade may be substituted for the WU by petition, except for master's degree\n                     students. (See Repeating Courses .) Grading Policies and Practices Grading. Students are expected to complete all requirements for a class by the end of the\n                  semester unless an incomplete is permitted by the instructor in accordance with university\n                  policy. Students shall not be assigned additional work or be allowed to revise previous\n                  assignments in order to improve a final grade. College Syllabus and Record Keeping. All faculty members shall provide students at the beginning of each semester a syllabus\n                  or outline stating course goals and objectives including grading methodology, types\n                  and number of projects, written assignments, tests, experiments, etc. Dean's List and President's List. Undergraduate students enrolled in at least 12 letter-graded units* during a regular\n                  matriculated term, earning no grade lower than a C, and earning at least a 3.5* grade\n                  point average (GPA) for the term are placed on the Dean's List for that term and a\n                  note is added to their transcript. Students meeting these requirements and having\n                  a 4.0* GPA for the term are placed on the President's List. * Excludes CR/NC and remedial/college readiness coursework. Repeating Courses . Undergraduate students may register for courses a second time only if they earned a grade of D, F, IC, or WU during the first attempt and they have\n                  not exceeded 28 units of repeated coursework. Topics courses with the same title and\n                  description are not repeatable for additional credit. Undergraduate students may not register to take a course more than two times until\n                  they complete the required paperwork, meet with a major advisor, obtain verification\n                  of all of the following conditions, and submit the verification to the major department\n                  chair for approval: they have not exceeded 28 units of repeated coursework, they received a grade of D, F, IC, or WU upon the second attempt of the course, the course to be repeated is a program requirement, the program they are pursuing requires a grade of C or higher in the course to fulfill\n                     a program requirement, and there are no other courses in the catalog that can be used to fulfill the program\n                     requirement. The chair will not grant this approval unless all of these conditions are met. If the request is approved, the student submits the required paperwork. Grade Substitution by Repetition of Courses. An undergraduate student may grade substitute up to 16 semester units of undergraduate\n                  coursework at California State University, Fresno. If the original grade was D, F,\n                  WU, or IC, and the subsequent grade is the same or higher, the new grade will be substituted\n                  for the original grade. Only the substituted grade will be used in determining the\n                  student's grade point average. Grade substitution can be used only once for an individual\n                  course. If the original grade was C, CR, or better, the course cannot be repeated.\n                  A student may repeat a total of 28 units, 16 of which may be used for grade substitution,\n                  as described above, and 12 units of which can be averaged. Grade forgiveness shall not be applicable to courses for which the original grade\n                  was the result of a finding of academic dishonesty (excerpt from EO 1037). A course in which a grade of NC was earned may be repeated but since the NC grade\n                  does not affect the grade point average, no substitution is necessary; however, the\n                  repeat will count toward the 12 unit limitation of averaged units. A course attempted at another institution may be eligible for grade substitution by\n                  repeating a regular California State University, Fresno course determined to be equivalent\n                  and articulated. A course for which grade substitution has been granted at another\n                  institution may not be repeated for grade substitution at California State University,\n                  Fresno. In addition, a course taken at California State University, Fresno may not be repeated\n                     for grade substitution at another institution. Postbaccalaureate students pursuing (1) a second baccalaureate degree, (2) a teaching\n                  credential, or (3) no specific objective, are also free to repeat a course and request\n                  grade substitution on the same basis as undergraduates provided the original course\n                  was completed when the student had postbaccalaureate standing. Postbaccalaureate students pursuing a doctoral degree, master's degree, or certificate\n                  of advanced study may, with approval of an advisor, repeat a course for academic credit,\n                  regardless of what grade was originally earned in the course. However, the student\n                  is not eligible to petition for grade substitution. All course work taken, beginning\n                  with the first term of the student's doctoral or master's degree program, is used\n                  in determining the student's grade point average and graduation eligibility. All appropriate grade substitutions will automatically be posted to the student’s\n                  records at the end of each semester except in cases in which the first attempt was\n                  at another institution. For these cases, contact the Office of the University Registrar\n                  by the last day of the semester. For further information, contact the Student Services Center located in the North\n                  Lobby, Joyal Administration Building. Academic Renewal. Under certain circumstances, the university may disregard up to two semesters (three\n                  quarters) of previous undergraduate coursework taken at California State University,\n                  Fresno or at any other college from all considerations associated with requirements\n                  for the baccalaureate degree. When such action is approved, the student's permanent\n                  academic record is marked to indicate that no work taken during the disregarded term(s), even if satisfactory, may apply toward\n                  baccalaureate requirements. However, all work must remain legible on the record ensuring\n                  a true and complete academic history. In order to qualify for renewal, all of the following conditions must be met: Five years must have elapsed since the most recent work to be disregarded was completed. It must be evident that the poor level of work represented by the term(s) under consideration\n                     is not representative (see No. 3) of the student's usual academic performance and\n                     was due to extenuating circumstances. The student must have completed the following in residence at California State University,\n                     Fresno since the most recent work to be disregarded was completed: (a.) 15 semester\n                     units with at least a 3.0 GPA or ( b.) 30 semester units with at least a 2.5 GPA or\n                     ( c.) 45 semester units with a 2.0 GPA. Work completed at another institution cannot\n                     be used to satisfy this request. It must be evident that it would be necessary for the student to complete one or more\n                     additional terms in order to qualify for the baccalaureate degree if the request were\n                     not approved, i.e., that the student would have less than a 2.0 grade point average\n                     in one or more of the following: (a) Cumulative collegiate coursework (b) All California\n                     State University, Fresno coursework (c) Coursework required for the major This policy may not be used in concert with any other academic forgiveness policy\n                     impacting particular academic term(s). For further information or to apply for academic renewal, contact the Undergraduate\n                  Degree Evaluations, 559.278.4076. Leave of Absence. A leave of absence is defined as a planned interruption or pause in a student’s regular\n                  academic attendance. In effect, the student temporarily ceases formal studies at California\n                  State University, Fresno, while pursuing other activities that may assist in clarifying\n                  and/or contributing to educational goals. It may also involve a military or medical\n                  leave. The intent of the policy is to make it possible for a student to suspend his\n                  or her academic work, leave the campus without jeopardizing rights and privileges,\n                  and later resume studies with a minimum of procedural difficulty. A student who is approved for a Leave of Absence will be considered a continuing Fresno\n                  State student and will maintain “catalog rights”.  If the student registers at Fresno\n                  State at the conclusion of the granted leave, (an) application for readmission will\n                  not be required. A planned educational leave for graduate students must be recommended by the Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies, Frank W. Thomas Building, Room 130 and requires\n                  an additional signature of your Graduate Program Coordinator. The following regulations apply to a leave of absence: Eligible students must have completed at least one semester at Fresno State and be\n                     in good academic standing. Leave of Absences are granted for two to four consecutive semesters only. Exception:\n                     Military active duty orders are extended for the duration of the orders as noted. In addition to recommendation by a faculty advisor and a chair, international students\n                     must be recommended by an advisor of international student services and programs,\n                     and educational opportunity program students by an EOP counselor. If you are requesting\n                     a military leave, an additional signature is required from the Veterans Resource Center. Petitions for leave of absence must be filed (with the appropriate recommendation)\n                     at the Registrar’s Office before the first day of classes for the semester during\n                     which the leave is to begin. Leaves are not approved for students dismissed due to academic deficiencies or disciplinary\n                     actions are not eligible for leaves of absence. A leave is not approved if the student plans to attend another institution, unless\n                     the coursework the student seeks is not available at California State University,\n                     Fresno. Any academic credit earned while on a planned educational leave is accredited\n                     by California State University, Fresno only if permission is granted for that credit\n                     in advance. Students who do not return to the university at the conclusion of their leave of absence\n                     and those who enroll elsewhere will be considered to have withdrawn from the university\n                     at the end of their last semester of regular enrollment at California State University,\n                     Fresno and will have to reapply for admission upon their return. Students wishing to apply for a Leave of Absence should obtain an online form from\n                  the Registrar Office website. Please review the form for required documentation before\n                  submission. Students will be notified by Fresno State email with a decision and may\n                  be asked for additional information. Student Academic Petitions. The Student Academic Petitions Committee has the authority to permit exceptions to\n                  university baccalaureate degree requirements when fulfilling the degree requirement\n                  would prove to be an undue hardship for the student and/or such an exception can be\n                  demonstrated to be educationally justifiable. The committee will take action only\n                  upon the submission of a formal petition by the student that sets forth the facts\n                  and circumstances that may warrant special consideration. Petitions and procedural information are available in the University Advising Center.\n                  The Petitions Committee does not make decisions pertaining to substitutions for undergraduate and graduate major requirements.\n                  Such requests are initiated through the student's department. Requests to waive established\n                  university policy governing graduate study may be addressed to the dean, Division\n                  of Research and Graduate Studies. If a request cannot be accommodated, it is forwarded\n                  to the Graduate Committee. Contact University Advising Center for further assistance with student academic petitions. Grade Protests. The Student Academic Petitions Committee also has the responsibility of handling\n                  grade protests for all students, undergraduate and postbaccalaureate. Students who\n                  believe they have been graded unfairly or incorrectly by an instructor must consult\n                  first with the faculty member concerned within the first 15 working days of the following\n                  semester and make every effort to resolve the issue. The instructor has five working\n                  days to respond. For cases in which an incorrect grade was assigned due to a recording\n                  error, the instructor will submit a Grade Correction Request form to the Office of\n                  the University Registrar. If the issue is not resolved, a student must immediately consult with the department\n                  chair, who will give the student an answer within 10 working days. If a student still\n                  believes that the grade was assigned unfairly or incorrectly after completing this\n                  process, the student then may request that the Student Academic Petitions Committee\n                  review the issue. To request review, students must immediately make an appointment\n                  with an academic counselor in the University Advising Center (Joyal, Rm. 224; 559.278.1787)\n                  to discuss their particular situation and to receive a copy of the university's grade\n                  protest policy as well as additional procedural instructions. Students then must submit a written statement no later than midsemester setting forth\n                  all pertinent details to the chair of the Petitions Committee. Readmission of Disqualified Students, Undergraduate and Graduate Undergraduate . Disqualified students who have not attended for more than two semesters must submit\n                  an application for readmission to the university and the appropriate readmission petition.\n                  Readmission occurs for fall semesters only. Prospective students can apply through\n                  CalStateApply between October 1 - January 17 for the following fall semester. Contact 559.278.2261 for more information. Postbaccalaureate/Graduate . To be considered for readmission to the university after disqualification, graduate\n                  and advanced certificate students must submit a “Petition for Readmission of Disqualified\n                  Graduate or Advanced Certificate Student” form to their graduate (or advanced certificate)\n                  program coordinator. Petitions are available online at https://academics.fresnostate.edu/drgs/gradstudies/forms/index.html . Disqualified graduate (or advanced certificate) students who petition for readmission\n                  AFTER having been out of attendance for a semester or more, must also reapply for\n                  admission through Cal State Apply. Additionally, students who seek a second baccalaureate\n                  or credential are asked to obtain the recommendation of the department/program to\n                  which they seek readmission. Students who are undeclared must have the approval of\n                  the dean of Division of Research and Graduate Studies to be readmitted to the university. Student Absences Students are expected to attend class and should maintain contact with their faculty\n                  members regarding any absences. Individual faculty members should be contacted when\n                  there are extended absences (more than one week) due to illness, death in the immediate\n                  family, or other situations. In urgent or extraordinary emergencies that preclude\n                  direct contact with individual faculty, students may contact the Office of the Vice\n                  President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at 559.278.2541. Any make-up\n                  work or missed assignments remain the responsibility of the student. Transcript Evaluation Undergraduate transfer students are usually evaluated under the degree requirements\n                  listed in the General Catalog at the time they enter California State University,\n                  Fresno. Transfer students who accept their admission offer and register for a mandatory Dog\n                  Days session should receive an email with instructions on how to access their computerized\n                  evaluation (DPR - Degree Progress Report). The DPR provides detail regarding the acceptance\n                  and processing of transfer coursework and also indicates remaining degree requirements.\n                  It is recommended that students access their DPR through self-service at least once\n                  a semester and review it with their academic advisor. A degree evaluation is completed\n                  during the semester a student files for graduation. (See Graduation and Commencement.) All official transcripts submitted by the student either in support of an application\n                  for admission or for degree completion become the property of California State University,\n                  Fresno and are not returned to the student. Students are strongly encouraged to obtain\n                  duplicate copies of their records from high school and colleges previously attended\n                  for their personal file. Transcripts and Grade Reports Transcript of Record. Students may request transcripts of their academic records at California State University,\n                  Fresno. Transcripts are not provided to students with administrative holds as determined\n                  by university officials. Transcripts of records from other institutions submitted to California State University,\n                     Fresno are not returned to students. For more information on how to order, visit www.fresnostate.edu/transcripts . Grade Reports to Students.

Requirements Department of Biology Bachelor of Science Degree Requirements in Biology The Bachelor of Science in Biology is a 120-unit program. Of the total, 48 units are\n                        required to satisfy the university's General Education Program and 21 units are required\n                        by the Department of Biology to satisfy the biology core. The core curriculum is a\n                        sequence of courses required for all biology majors. The core curriculum builds the\n                        foundation upon which further learning in biology will be based. Additional requirements\n                        are listed below. The biology degree program prepares students for entry into a wide range of careers,\n                        for further academic study at the graduate level, including the department's own M.S.\n                        in Biology, and for entrance into professional degree programs. Within the scope of\n                        the major requirements and electives, students may focus their studies in areas that\n                        best meet their future career needs. Students must consult an advisor for help in\n                        selecting courses appropriate to their interests and career objectives. An emphasis\n                        on cellular and molecular processes prepares students for the department's professional\n                        science Master of Biotechnology. Students planning for graduate and professional schools should be aware that entrance\n                        requirements for those programs will often exceed the minimal requirements for a Biology\n                        B.S., particularly in the ancillary fields of chemistry, physics, and mathematics.\n                        An advisor should be consulted for specific information on graduate and professional\n                        school requirements.

Chicano studies majors are not permitted to take CLAS courses by CR/NC grading (unless\n                           the courses are only offered on that basis). General Education and elective units may be used toward a double major or minor (see\n                           double major or other departmental minor). Consult the appropriate department chair,\n                           program coordinator or faculty advisor for further information. Students who are planning to do graduate work in Chicano or Latin American studies\n                           are advised to study Spanish and/or Portuguese. Back to Top Faculty The Chicano and Latin American Studies Department consists of faculty whose teaching\n                        and research expertise cover a broad spectrum, including anthropology, education,\n                        history, sociology, political science, Latin America, Latinx literature, and the arts.\n                        CLAS hosts the yearly Latin American Film Festival to bring Latin American films and\n                        filmmakers to the Central Valley. The department is home to one of Central California’s\n                        premier Mexican folkloric dance programs, Los Danzantes de Aztlán. This performance\n                        troupe is the only group of its kind in the entire CSU system to be designated as\n                        an official representative of a CSU campus (Fresno). The offices of the department\n                        also serve as a resource center for many of the Chicanx/Latinx student organizations\n                        and as an information center for the community.

Roadmap B.A. in Chicano-Studies A Roadmap identifies the specific set of courses students must complete in their major\n                           in sequential order. Information on corequisites or prerequisites is listed along\n                           with other pertinent information to assist students in completing courses towards\n                           the major. For the most up-to-date roadmap, please contact the College Advising Center or check\n                           your My Degree Plan. Please note: Roadmaps are not a guarantee of course availability. If you are looking for archived roadmaps, please click here. Back to Top Careers Chicanxs and Latinxs are the largest ethnic group in California. This segment of our\n                        population will have a major impact on our society, as its presence translates into\n                        an increasing economic and political influence. Crucial social, economic, and political\n                        decisions will be made that affect this group and the nation at large. The growth\n                        of Latinx-owned businesses, Spanish language media networks, and political organizations\n                        are all indicators of the importance of the Spanish-speaking people in the U.S. economy. Chicano Studies majors are trained to analyze social issues, to think critically,\n                        and to conduct research. All majors receive applied as well as theoretical training\n                        with a school or community agency to observe firsthand the social issues and theories\n                        which they study. These skills are useful in professional life and are valued in the\n                        public and private sectors. Students of non-Latinx origin find that Chicano and Latin American Studies courses\n                        are personally rewarding because they enable them to understand and relate to persons\n                        of different social and cultural backgrounds. Chicanx and Latinx students find these\n                        courses highly conducive to strengthening their sense of identity and pride in their\n                        heritage. Students who graduate with a B.A. in Chicano Studies or Latin American Studies, or\n                        who minor in Chicano/Latino Studies and Latin American Studies work in such fields\n                        as education, public administration, psychology, marketing, journalism, social services,\n                        and throughout the public and private sectors. Physicians, educators, lawyers, counselors,\n                        civil service employees, and other professionals have found that training in Chicano\n                        and Latin American studies improves their abilities to serve their clients and enhance\n                        their employment and advancement opportunities. Students with a B.A. in Chicano Studies can enter master’s or doctoral programs in\n                        the humanities and social sciences and in professional schools in such areas as Chicanx\n                        studies, ethnic studies, anthropology, political science, history, public administration,\n                        Latinx literature, multimedia, social work, and education. Also, students are encouraged\n                        to pursue double majors and minors; one in Chicano Studies and the second in a professional\n                        area of their preference. Students with questions related to their future careers\n                        or seeking advising assistance should consult with the major and minor advisors of\n                        the Chicano and Latin American Studies Department.

Back to Top Careers Urban and regional planners develop land use plans and programs that help create communities,\n                        accommodate population growth, and revitalize transportation infrastructure and public\n                        facilities in towns, cities, counties, and metropolitan areas, and also preserve natural\n                        resources, and as well address problems caused by pollution, and to use planning to\n                        reduce the impact of natural disasters. What You Can Do Employment of urban and regional planners is projected to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the 7% average for all occupations. Demographic, transportation,\n                        and evironmental changes will drive employment growth for planners. (US Bureau of\n                        Labor Statistics). California is a state requiring all municipalities and counties to develop and adopt\n                           a General Plan with at least seven elements, and to update plan elements on a 5-year\n                           basis. Green House Gas Reduction targets increase the need for municipalities and counties\n                           develop their own Climate Action Plans. Water quality and quantity management are matters of great importance to central and\n                           southern California. Water quantity and quality districts throughout the state employ\n                           planners. Across the country, about two-thirds of all planners are employed in the public sector.\n                           In 2010 there was an estimated 245 planners in the Central Valley. This is expected\n                           to increase to 282 by 2020 and to 375 by 2030. California has: 58 counties, 451 cities, 3,500 special districts, dozens of consulting\n                           firms, and state and federal positions, and they all need planners.

Back to Top Careers Cognitive Science Cognitive Science is an emerging field that brings together various approaches to\n                        the study of human cognition, drawing from psychology, linguistics, neuroscience,\n                        philosophy and computer science. Historically, study in Cognitive Science has been\n                        conducted within these traditional disciplines and such study still represents important\n                        areas of research, as in cognitive psychology within psychology or artificial intelligence\n                        within computer science. However, increasingly many researchers and practitioners\n                        are feeling a need for a background that integrates basic knowledge in the foundational\n                        disciplines and prepares them to work across academic fields. The broad-based multidisciplinary degree program in Cognitive Science develops and\n                        provides a thorough foundation in the study of cognitive science, drawing in perspectives\n                        from computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology; and to provide a foundation\n                        in cognitive science What You Can Do Pursue jobs in business and industry where a multidisciplinary background is highly\n                        desirable, such as the technology industry, publishing, or law enforcement.

Back to Top Careers Economics is the social science that studies the way in which societies are organized\n                        to produce the goods and services that sustain and enhance the life processes of the\n                        community. As a fundamental scientific discipline, economics employs systematic analysis in the\n                        study of the production and distribution of income within and among nations. Since\n                        all social policy issues in modern societies have an economic dimension, the study\n                        of economics offers the student an opportunity to investigate the most important and\n                        exciting problems of political economy facing the world today. Career Opportunities Graduates of the department pursue a variety of challenging careers in industry, finance,\n                        education, government and international organizations.

Students also must fulfill the university's General Education requirements\n                        (48 units). The English Department requires two college-level courses in the same\n                        foreign language (or equivalent) for all English major degree options (see Advising\n                        Note 2). 1.

Note: English\n                        majors take ENGL 106W to fulfill the Upper-division Writing requirement. 4. Sufficient elective units to meet required total units (varies) 5. Total units (120)* * G.E. and Other requirement courses can be double-counted with major requirements. \n                        See advisor for details. Advising Notes A single course may fulfill the requirement in more than one of the above content\n                           categories, with approval of the program advisor, but will not reduce the number of\n                           total units required for the major. The language requirement may be fulfilled by a sequence of two semesters of the same\n                           language. However, if a student demonstrates advanced proficiency by completing the\n                           final course in a language sequence (e.g., the fourth semester course in a language),\n                           or an advanced reading course, that single course may fulfill this requirement with\n                           the approval of the faculty advisor. CR/NC grading is not permitted in the English major with the exception of 2 units\n                           total of ENGL 186. General Education and elective units may be used toward a double major or minor (see\n                           double major or departmental minor). Consult the appropriate department chair, program\n                           coordinator, or faculty advisor for further information. Courses counted to fulfill a minor cannot also be used to fulfill major requirements. ENGL 105 and 106W provide a basis for most Upper Division coursework. Therefore, those\n                           classes should be completed by first semester of a student’s Junior year, or as soon\n                           as possible thereafter. English majors considering eventual graduate degrees should consult the graduate advisor. Back to Top Faculty The English Department consists of 26 full-time faculty whose teaching fields cover\n                        every area of literary studies and the humanities, including film and folklore. Most\n                        of the faculty have published books, textbooks, and articles in their disciplines,\n                        five have received outstanding teaching awards at the university, and one has received\n                        an outstanding teaching award for the entire CSU system. In addition, the faculty\n                        includes a number of lecturers, part-time instructors and teaching assistants, and\n                        the department operates an English writing lab staffed by tutors trained to work with\n                        students on an individual basis.

Advising Notes From Fall 2019, students wishing to change their major to Criminology or Forensic\n                           Behavioral Sciences will need to have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5. These courses are also required for the other three Options in the Criminology major. CRIM 1 is a prerequisite for CRIM 180I. Special note: Due to its importance for all\n                           Criminology majors, CRIM 1 should be taken as early as possible. This requirement may also be met by completing PSYCH 42, PH 92, MATH 11, DS 73, or\n                           any equivalent statistics course from another university or community college. Students must choose either PSYCH 127 or PSYCH 128 as one of their upper-division\n                           requirements. When they choose one of these courses as an upper-division requirement,\n                           they may choose the other as their Psychology Electives Cluster course. Students must take FBS 114 or CRIM 102 as a prerequisite or corequisite for CRIM 180I. FBS students may receive only 3 units of credit for any combination of CRIM 108 or\n                           180I toward major requirements. FBS students may receive only 3 units of credit for CRIM 136T (Mock Trial) toward\n                           major requirements. PSYCH 160T, depending upon the topic, has a variable number of units (2 to 5 units).\n                           To qualify as an acceptable Psychology Electives Cluster course for FBS, the course\n                           must be worth a minimum of 4 units. Back to Top Faculty The criminology department consists of 16 full-time faculty members whose expertise\n                        includes numerous specialties in the criminal justice system, including corrections,\n                        counseling, victimology, juvenile delinquency, theory, legal studies, supervision\n                        and management, and criminal justice administration.

Geographers examine and analyze patterns\n                        of rural and urban settlement, resource exploitation, land use, social and cultural\n                        phenomena. They are concerned with the natural features and processes of the earth's\n                        surface, the ways in which nature has conditioned the human occupance of the earth,\n                        and the ways in which people have modified natural landscapes. In sum, geography seeks to provide a broad understanding of the world, its people,\n                        and its problems and to provide applied specializations and technical skills that\n                        can address economic, social, and environmental problems at scales that range from\n                        local to global.

Just as\n                        the personalities of individuals are shaped through the totality of their past experiences,\n                        so cultures and institutions also develop in time. The study of history can help students\n                        understand themselves and their culture better and develop a more tolerant and humane\n                        spirit toward others. In this way, as in so many others, a knowledge of the past can\n                        help all of us meet the problems of today with greater under standing and compassion. History majors are trained to read with comprehension and to compare and analyze both\n                        written and oral material. In addition they must know how to evaluate evidence and\n                        sources, how to critique the writing of others, and how to do research and writing\n                        on their own. The Department of History has more than 15 faculty members offering a wide variety\n                        of courses in the history of Europe, the United States, Latin America, the British\n                        Empire, Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East, as well as courses in intellectual\n                        and cultural history, social history, military history, and the history of women.

The program is most suitable for working adults or those who otherwise would\n                        not return to Fresno State to complete a traditional degree program. The program offers\n                        significant flexibility through a choice of online courses to satisfy degree requirements\n                        within a one- to two-year program. Through an innovative, online program of interactive and project-based learning, students\n                        gain depth of knowledge and make connections across disciplines. They learn to draw\n                        on rich and varied liberal arts to address current challenges in careers, local communities,\n                        and the world. Graduates leave with critical thinking, oral and written communication,\n                        and leadership skills fundamental to successful, resilient careers. The major also\n                        prepares students for graduate study in a range of fields. Past Fresno State students with at least 70 units in good standing, who have completed\n                        at least 12 units in previous enrollment at the Fresno State campus, and who have\n                        not been enrolled at Fresno State for at least three years prior to enrollment in\n                        this program are eligible to apply. All lower division General Education (G.E.) requirements\n                        must be satisfied prior to enrollment.

Program Mission Statement : This online degree completion program leading to a B.A. in Liberal Arts creates\n                        a pathway to degree completion for former Fresno State students who left the university\n                        in good academic standing without having earned an undergraduate degree in any discipline. Interdisciplinary studies in this program foster connections among disciplines and\n                        draw upon multiple areas of knowledge to develop student competence in analysis, communication,\n                        creativity, human diversity, ethics, and leadership in order to engage challenges\n                        in a variety of career and community contexts. Coursework supports an interdisciplinary, liberal arts approach to issues of particular\n                        significance to residents of the Central Valley region. Critical thinking, communication,\n                        creativity, and problem solving based courses place regional questions in a global\n                        context and bridge liberal arts learning with career development and civic engagement.

See advisor for\n                        details. The Culminating Experience for the Applied Mathematics Option consists of the following: A Junior Seminar (MATH 193A) in Applied Mathematics in the spring semester of the year prior to graduation, and A Senior Project (MATH 198) in Applied Mathematics which will include a report and a presentation in the Junior Seminar in the spring semester of student's graduating year. Advising Notes PHYS 4AL is not required for the math major. If students wish to include PHYS 4A as\n                           a General Education Breadth course, they must also take PHYS 4AL. Three units of MATH 75 (or MATH 75A) also will satisfy the G.E. Foundation B4 requirement. See Mathematics Road Map at http://www.fresnostate.edu/degreeroadmap/ Advising Requirements. It is strongly recommended, to all math majors, to have an advising session at least\n                              once a semester. See the department chair for assignment to an advisor. Grade Requirements . All courses required as prerequisites for a mathematics course must be completed\n                              with a grade of C or better before registration will be permitted.

Roadmap Bachelor of Science in Mathematics A Roadmap identifies the specific set of courses students must complete in their major\n                           in sequential order. Information on corequisites or prerequisites is listed along\n                           with other pertinent information to assist students in completing courses towards\n                           the major. For the most up-to-date roadmap, please contact the College Advising Center or check\n                           your My Degree Plan. Please note: Roadmaps are not a guarantee of course availability. If you are looking for archived roadmaps, please click here. Back to Top Careers Careers A degree in mathematics can open the door to a huge range of amazing careers. After\n                        all, math is involved in just about every job in some way, and it's particularly essential\n                        in the in-demand fields of science, technology, and engineering. Math majors tend\n                        to have well-developed skills in logical thinking and problem solving. They are experts\n                        at analyzing data and creating models to extract meaningful conclusions. They can\n                        identify patterns and use quantitative data to construct solutions. That's why the\n                        kind of jobs you can get with a math degree are so diverse. You could pursue careers\n                        in areas like insurance, banking, education, logistics, and more. Math skills are clearly important in many careers, most notably the science, technology,\n                        and engineering professions. But such skills also feature prominently in some careers\n                        that may not seem like a natural end point for someone with a math degree. Video game\n                        developer and computer animator are just two examples of less-obvious jobs that actually\n                        use calculus, for instance. What You Can Do Teach, pursue advanced degree, or work in finance-related fields, business, government,\n                        and industry; actuarial work. A major in mathematics is a springboard to a wide range of rewarding careers. Whether\n                        you focus on theoretical mathematics, applied math or statistics, the analytical and\n                        quantitative skills you develop in a math program are valuable assets that many employers\n                        need. Take a look at some of the types of organizations that hire math majors: Government agencies and academic research institutes Engineering firms Biomedical and health services companies Insurance agencies Real estate firms Medical device manufacturers Airlines and other transportation service providers Financial institutions What You Can Earn The list below is meant to inspire your career exploration, but don't think you're\n                        limited to these suggestions. Many jobs that don't specifically mention math degrees\n                        are available to graduates with these skills, so don't sell yourself short. You likely\n                        have more options than you realize. It should be noted that several careers in the\n                        mathematical sciences also require a master’s or doctoral degree.
