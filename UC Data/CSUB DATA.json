Learn more Frequently Asked Questions Expand All | Collapse All Why are software updates necessary? Microsoft is committed to providing its customers with software that has been tested for safety and security. Although no system is completely secure, we use processes, technology, and several specially focused teams to investigate, fix, and learn from security issues to help us meet this goal and to provide guidance to customers on how to help protect their PCs. As part of the Microsoft software release process, all software released to the Download Center is scanned for malware before it is made available for public download. Additionally, after release, the software available from the Download Center is routinely scanned for malware. Microsoft recognizes that the threat environment is constantly changing and will continue to evolve over time, and we are committed to process improvements that will help protect our customers from malware threats How can I keep my software up to date? Microsoft offers a range of online services to help you keep your computer up to date. Windows Update finds updates that you might not even be aware of and provides you with the simplest way to install updates that help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience. Visit Windows Update to learn more. What can I find in the Microsoft Download Center, and how do I find what I’m looking for? The Microsoft Download Center has recently been revised to better serve you as a one-stop shop for products available for purchase, in addition to products and downloads available for free. For your convenience, items available for purchase are linked directly to Microsoft Store. Items available as free downloads are linked to details pages, where you can learn more about them and initiate downloads. If you would like Microsoft to scan your computer and recommend updates, please see the preceding question. If you would like to search for specific downloads, start by using one of these methods. To find products and downloads, in the navigation bar that appears across the center of the Download Center home page, click an icon. To search more specifically for a product or download, on the menu bar displayed near the top of the page, click a menu name and then click a product or download. To search by keyword, at the top of the page, in the Search Download Center search box, type the word or words you wish to search for. On the Search results page, you may see the following: An Editor's choice listing of products and downloads, which are recommendations based on the search term. A Sort by box on the right side of the page. Click the down arrow, and select a display order for the search results. A list of Filter options on the left side of the page. Click a Filter option to narrow the list of items displayed in the search results. The Filter option operates together with the original search term to narrow the scope of search results. When you see the item you’re interested in, click the item link to find out more about downloading or purchasing it. How do I find worldwide downloads? Microsoft delivers downloads in more than 118 languages worldwide. The Download Center now combines all English downloads into a single English Download Center. We no longer offer separate downloads for U.S. English, U.K. English, Australian English, or Canadian English. Select a Worldwide download from the English-language site On the download details page for a particular item, under Quick details, you will see a Change language box. Select the desired language from the drop-down list Note: The Change Language box appears only when a worldwide version of the download is available. If the box does not appear, the download has not yet been made available in languages other than English. If you see the box, but a specific language is not listed, the download is not yet available in that language. Which other Microsoft websites offer downloads? In this section, you will find links to other Microsoft websites that offer downloads. Note that almost all of the downloads available from these websites can also be found in the Microsoft Download Center; however, the other Microsoft sites may offer services and information that you may not find in the Download Center. If you are looking for downloads for the Windows operating system or for Microsoft Office, try using Windows Update , which helps you keep your computer up to date without requiring you to visit the Download Center. DirectX downloads Get the latest version of Microsoft DirectX, and find other important DirectX updates for your version of Windows. Service Packs for Microsoft Products Download service packs containing updates for system reliability, program compatibility, and security. See which service packs are currently available from Microsoft Help and Support. Windows Media Download Center Amplify your play with Microsoft Windows Media Player, encoders, codecs, and other related downloads. Azure downloads Get SDKs and tools for managing and interacting with Azure services Windows developer resources Get downloads and tools for Windows development Code samples Get started with Microsoft developer tools and technologies. Explore our samples and discover the things you can build. What should I do if I can’t find what I am looking for? If you cannot find a specific download, it may be available from a company other than Microsoft. Popular examples include Adobe Reader, Macromedia Shockwave and Flash players, and Java software. For current links to these downloads on their respective websites, use Bing to search the web for the download you are looking for. What information will I find on download pages? When you click a download item in the Download Center, you will be directed to the download details page for that download. Most of these pages follow a standard format and include most of the sections described here. Quick details The Quick details section contains helpful summary information, including the name and size of the download file and its date of publication. Change language In some cases, you'll see a Change language box, from which you can select a language other than English. Note that some downloads are not available in all languages. In addition, not all non-English downloads are accompanied by localized details pages. As a result, you may find English descriptions and instructions on pages for non-English downloads. Download button or link For each file listed, you will see a Download button or link in the Quick details section. Click this button or link to begin the download. Overview The Overview section includes a brief explanation of the issues addressed by the download and the benefits it provides. System requirements Always check the System requirements section to make sure your computer is compatible with and has the space required to install and run the download. This section may also list required or recommended application software. Instructions Review the Instructions section before clicking the Download button, so you are prepared for any steps you may need to follow. What others are downloading This lists other items downloaded by people who also downloaded the current item. Information about these related downloads can be very helpful. Additional information This provides further information that is either directly related to the current download or is meant to help keep your system running securely, such as security update information. Related resources These links take you to how-to information, newsgroups, special offers, and other resources pertinent to the download you have selected. What should I do if I cannot complete a download? If you cannot complete a download, you may need to clear the cache in your browser.  Here are Instructions for how to clear the cache in Microsoft Edge . How do I install downloaded software? Before you can use any software that you download, you must install it. For example, if you download a security update but do not install it, the update will not provide any protection for your computer. Follow these steps to save and install a download: On the download details page, click the Download button. A dialogue box will open. Click the Save button. You will be prompted to select a location for the download on your computer. Select an appropriate location, and click the Save button. When the file has finished downloading, you will see a second dialog box. If you want to install the file immediately, click the Open button. This launches an installation wizard. If you do not want to immediately install the file, click the Close button. When you are ready to install the file, double-click the file to launch the installation wizard. Note: When you save a download file, make sure to save it to a location that you will remember when you are ready to install the download.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is our top priority. We place special emphasis on sourcing responsibly, operating efficiently, minimizing food waste and reducing packaging. Green Thread® represents our ongoing commitment to reducing our environmental impact through programs and practices that enrich and support the natural environment. Through everyday actions, we bring innovative and efficient solutions to life. We are passionately focused on improving our own operations, while offering expertise and practical solutions. But we don't stop there. We measure our impact and hold ourselves accountable to continuously improve. Source Responsibly We purchase local, seasonal and responsibly raised, grown and sourced products whenever possible. We firmly believe responsible sourcing has a direct impact on people, animals, and the environment. We engage suppliers and partners to source environmentally and socially responsible products. Minimize Food Waste We reduce food waste across our operations with the dual goals of conserving resources and keeping food out of landfills. Our practices include back of house operational practices to reduce waste before it’s generated, programs to help consumers decrease food waste, feeding those in need during instances of excess safe, unserved food, and finally implementing composting programs wherever possible. Operate Efficiently We implement practices to conserve natural resources and reduce our environmental footprint. Fueled by the understanding that our day-to-day actions have an impact, we work closely with our clients to conserve energy and water. We also minimize our use of fossil fuels and emissions across our fleet of vehicles. Reduce Packaging We minimize our waste by reducing, reusing and recycling. Across our operations, we have established practices from initial purchase to final waste disposal that decrease the overall cost of waste both environmentally and financially. We place special emphasis on reducing single-use plastics – skipping straws and stirrers across our operations is just the beginning. . What We're Doing on Campus We work together to continually develop and implement sustainable solutions. What We're Doing on Campus Our purpose is simple - to make a positive impact on people and planet. Our sustainability plan starts with people. People are at the center of everything we do and so we’re focused on equity and wellbeing of our employees and consumers, the people in the communities where we live and work, as well as the people in our supply chain. We also focus on the wellbeing of our planet by minimizing environmental impact across all of our operations, from the foods we serve and facilities we operate to the vehicles we drive.

Situation Contact Situation The student’s conduct is clearly and imminently reckless, disorderly, dangerous, or threatening including self-harm behavior. Contact Call 911 or Campus Police. Situation The student shows signs of distress but I am unsure how serious it is. My interaction has left me feeling uneasy and/or really concerned about the student. Contact Consult with and/or refer to the Counseling Center. Situation I’m not concerned for the student’s immediate safety, but he or she is having significant academic and/or personal issues and could use some support or additional resources. Contact Refer students to an appropriate campus resource. SEE SOMETHING. CSU faculty and staff are in a unique position to demonstrate compassion for CSU students in distress. Both undergraduate and graduate students may feel alone, isolated, and even hopeless when faced with academic and life challenges. These feelings can easily disrupt academic performance and may lead to difficulties coping and other serious consequences. You may be the first person to SEE SOMETHING distressing in your students since you have frequent and prolonged contact with them. The California State University, in collaboration with the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA), requests that you act with compassion when assisting students. SAY SOMETHING. Students exhibiting troubling behaviors  in your presence are likely having  difficulties in various settings including  the classroom, with roommates, with  family, and even in social settings. Trust your instincts and SAY  SOMETHING if a student leaves you  feeling worried, alarmed or threatened! DO SOMETHING. Sometimes students cannot or  will not turn to family or friends.  DO SOMETHING!

LISTEN SENSITIVELY AND CAREFULLY : Use a non-confrontational approach and a calm voice. Avoid threatening, humiliating and intimidating responses. SAFETY FIRST : The welfare of the campus community is the top priority when a student displays threatening or potentially violent behavior. Do not hesitate to call for help.

Our focus is on the improvement in four key areas that we refer to as our \"pillars\".  The Four Pillars are described below: Academic excellence will continue to be a top priority and we believe we have created a strong foundation with the help of the $870,000 NCAA grant that was received in 2016. The grant, along with other department, institutional, and private investments, have put the Kegley Center for Student Success and the academic support division in a strong position for future growth and improvement. It is our goal to provide the best possible overall student-athlete experience . In order to enhance this area, we have placed a strong focus on improving our facilities. We recently completed a Master Plan for Athletics Facilities and will work with the campus and community to make improvements to the buildings and fields that our students call \"home\". In addition, we will offer a comprehensive life skills and engagement program for our students that include mentoring opportunities and training that prepares them for life after college and after sports. Community engagement is vital to the success of CSU Bakersfield Athletics. We are Bakersfield's only NCAA Division I program and we hope that we are creating a product that the community can be proud of and want to support in what ever way they are able. We need to continue to increase our revenue through ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and fundraising. We are in a \"growth phase\" and we want everyone in the community to come along for the ride. And of course, we want to win. Competitive success is important to all of our coaches and staff and we will strive to put CSUB, the Bakersfield community, and all Kern County on the map in a positive and inspirational way.

        "url": "https://www.gorunners.com/TheMarathon",
        "body": "The Marathon - CSUB Loading Bakersfield, Calif. - Â My name is Andie Easley, and Iâm currently heading into my third year on the womenâs basketball team at CSU Bakersfield. Recently, I was asked what my scholarship means to me. Its a difficult question and one I cannot fully I answer without sharing my story. Continue Reading Below... I was born right here in Bakersfield, although I grew up in Phoenix, Ariz. My mom was too sick to have children on her own so my Aunt, who lives in Bakersfield, carried my twin sister and me as a surrogate. After I was born my parents brought us back to Phoenix. My mom has been in end-stage renal failure my entire life, so I spent most of my childhood at doctor appointments or sleeping with her in hospital beds. When I reached driving age, I became her unofficial chauffeur, bringing her to and from dialysis 3-4 times a week. When I wasnât with my Mom, or at school, I was on the basketball court or in the gym. As early as I can remember, it has always been basketball that has kept me going; and I became obsessed with earning a collegiate basketball scholarship. Playing in college was my dream and chasing that dream became my safe place. Iâm not sure I would have had the opportunity to receive a college education without that dream. After high school, I was able to achieve my dream and earn a basketball scholarship at the Division I level - and for better or worse, it has always been more than I bargained for. I spent my first couple of seasons at a different university, where I struggled with injury and had a hard time coping without basketball. Additionally, my momâs health was getting worse and I was far away and unable to help take care of her. I felt as if I had zero support from the coaching staff, the faculty, the administration or the university as a whole and I began questioning my value as a person. It was the lowest point in my life and I had a decision to make. Should I just give up on myself? Should I give up on my dream of playing basketball? After a lot of prayer and reliance on my faith, I entered the transfer portal in search of a better opportunity and a more supportive situation. More than anything I was searching for my happiness and a support system that would allow me to thrive on and off the court. I ended was in the portal for only five hours! When Coach McCall contacted me, I knew that CSUB was the home and the family I was looking for. From my very first week on campus, I felt wanted and supported. I never met the athletic director at my previous school and I couldnât have even told you the name of the school president. At CSUB, Ziggy is someone I look forward to seeing on campus, Dr. Wallace is someone Iâve grown to admire and President Zelezny cheers me on by name court side at home games! The list goes on. I have always found unwavering support from the coaching staff, and they are consistently reminding me of my value as a person - and not only as a basketball player. At my last college, I lost motivation to perform academically and my relationship with basketball struggled. At CSUB, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA and my master's degree; I was named as the program's most outstanding student and became the first CSUB student to secure an internship at Memorial Hospital. The Big West Conference named me as a 2020-2021 Scholar Athlete of the Year. I was listed among the nationâs top ten female scholar athlete in Division I basketball and was the only female NCAA basketball player selected by the D1-AAA Athletics Director's Association to receive a post-graduate studies scholarship. I would have never been able to accomplish so much without the support I've received at CSUB. I'm so grateful for my time here and for these achievements, but most importantly, CSUB has given me back my happiness and sense of self-value again! For so long I dreamt about earning a college scholarship and playing basketball at the Division I level. but I never could have imagined all of this. I've been through so much and it's hard to sum up exactly what my scholarship has meant to me. It has given me so much more than simply the chance to play basketball at this level or earn an education; my time at CSUB has been an endless source of opportunity that I never would have otherwise had. Justin Finch was born in Bakersfield, while Tara Corcoran made her way to Kern County from Southern California. At CSUB they found home and family, and a future together... Justin Finch: Growing up, I played AYSO on the Soccer Fields right next to CSUB, in the old Region 73, and saw the campus change during athleticsâ transition from Division II to Division I. My mother was a volleyball setter at CSUB, and I knew she had enjoyed her college years as a Roadrunner. Tara (Corcoran) Finch: When I came to CSUB on my recruiting trip, I remember telling my mom that it felt like home. CSUB was a smaller school, but to me that was the charm as I had graduated from a smaller high school in Southern California. Continue Reading Below... Neither Finch nor Corcoran would attend CSUB their freshman seasons, but both found an immediate home after transferring to the Bakersfield campusâ¦ JF: I had played soccer since I age 3 but decided my senior year to kick and punt for my high school football team. Surprisingly, I was good and received an Athletic Scholarship to kick at Southwest Baptist. As much as I enjoyed the experience soccer was still my love and passion. TF: I started my college career at Long Beach State, but my Grandmother graduated from Bakersfield HS in 1948. I also have family that live here in Bakersfield. When I was looking for a new school to finish my collegiate career, I fell in love with the small campus and hometown feel at CSUB. The coaches and the girls in the program made it an easy choice. JF: When I came home to Bakersfield, I started playing in a multitude of local leagues and decided to walk on at CSUB. Fortunately, Head Coach Simon Tobin was looking for a defender and I made sure I was in the best shape of my life. I gave myself and chance and made the team. Both made an immediate impact on and off the field for the `Runners. Finch started three seasons in the central defense leading the CSUB men to three-straight conference titles, while Corcoran enjoyed some historic moments competing as an independent on the women's teamâ¦ JF: It was an honor to make the team at CSUB and represent the university and my hometown. The pride I had to play for Bakersfield must be similar to an International player who gets to represent their home country. At the time, we were a small fish in a big pond, but we were always up to the challenge of facing, and beating, schools like UCLA, USC or Cal every chance we had. TF: As a transfer student you always have a lot to prove. I knew Iâd have to work twice as hard to make a good impression on both my coaches and my teammates. I had spent some time playing semi-professionally with the Claremont starts and competing at such a fast-paced level allowed me to make an immediate impact with the Roadrunners. JF: As a defender our number one goal was to turn in clean sheets and prevent the other team from generating offensive chances. That is what we took pride in during those seasons. If we kept the other team off the scoreboard, we guaranteed ourselves a win or a tie. I did score three times, including once on a diving header assisted by my high school teammate Ken Taylor, and Iâll never forget those moments as well. TF: I remember beating #13 San Diego in 2009 for the first win over a ranked DI program in our womenâs soccer history. It taught me the lesson that better teams beat better players. Individuals can enjoy moments of brilliance, but to succeed takes teamwork, mutual respect, trust, commitment and anticipation. These are the skills I look for when I make my hiring decisions today, and I love hiring athletes because they already have this foundation. JF: We had a lot of success on the field at CSUB, but the time I spent with my roommate (goalkeeper) Eric Shannon, and all my teammates and coaches, are the memories I will never forget. Those connections, relationships and opportunities are what helped me develop into who I am today. Justin & Tara were introduced by their respective coaches early in their CSUB tenure and quickly hit it off. The two are now married and have remained in Bakersfield to raise their young family, putting into practice the lessons they learned as student-athletes with the `Runners to the benefit of the entire communityâ¦ TF: Justin and I weâre set up on a blind date by Nicole Van Dyke and Simon Tobin. It was funny, because I knew about the plan for more than a week, but Justin only found out that day. I remember walking up to the marketplace scared out of my mind and not knowing what to expect. I told my roommates Iâd be home within the hour. JF: She denies it, but supposedly Coach Van Dyke overheard Tara say something about me during our exhibition game against a Mexican National Team. I had scored on a PK and played pretty well. I thought the coaches were playing a trick on the new guy on the team, but I went along with the idea anyway. TF: All we had planned was dinner at Que Pasa, but we ended up going to Cold Stone and seeing the movie Surrogates as well. JF: It was not a very good movie, not one of Bruce Willisâ best. TF: Justin had asked me to hold his keys during the movie, and when I got home, he called me and said he had forgotten to get them back. I think this was his way of making sure he would see me again! It worked, because after that we spent time together on campus nearly every day. JF: We dated for seven years and weâll have been married for five more come July 22nd. We have two children, Talia (2) and Jace (8 mos.). TF: CSUB will always hold a special place in our hearts for so many reasons, but itâs the place that brought us together and started our family. We cannot wait to share more time together, and with our children, at `Runner sporting events in the future. Additionally, like so many CSUB student-athlete alumni, Justin and Tara have remained in the community and continue to impact the city, including young student-athletes across Kern Countyâ¦ TF: Bakersfield has a lot of charm. Itâs a large town, but also a lot smaller and closer knit than one might think. When I moved here, I started coaching high school (Garces Memorial JV) and club (Bakersfield Brigade) soccer. It meant so much to me when the community would come to support us on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons, and I love being able to return the favor. As an HR manager at Target, I love that my career allows me to support this community through volunteering and local recruiting. JF: I knew I wanted to be a high school athletic director from the moment I graduated from Garces. CSUB helped me in that pursuit, providing me with a Business Administration & Sport Management degree, but also providing experiences and opportunity that gave me the insight and perspective I needed to efficiently run a department. JF: It means so much to me to remain here in town as I pursue my career. It allows me to be close to my family, but also to give back to the young student-athletes of our community by developing the athletic programs that will help them grow and compete at the highest levels. For both the connection with CSUB exists as strong as everâ¦ JF: As you grow older and people head in different directions you donât have the time together that you once had, but those relationships created as a student-athlete remain. I stay in touch with so many people from my time as a student-athlete and those relationships have fostered new relationships with CSUB alumni young and old, in particular other athletes. For Finch, CSUB was always a family affairâ¦ JF: My mother was a `Runner and now my sister competes at CSUB. Julianne has always been a fantastic athlete and has developed into a skilled pole vaulter after only picking up the sport as a sophomore in high school. Itâs cool to see her competing for the same university my mom and myself once represented. Like the rest of us, sheâs so proud to compete for the school and our community. Looking back, Justin and Tara are adamant that the lessons learned, and time spent, in Bakersfield have dramatically impacted their lives, and the two remain committed to helping current and future student-athletes make the most of their student-athlete careersâ¦ JF: Iâd tell every current of future student-athlete to take advantage of every opportunity presented to them at CSUB. Play every game and practice at 100%, study hard in all of your classes and be present in the time you spend with your teammates and classmates on and off the field. Thatâs the key to creating stronger relationships and chemistry, and to personal growth and development. TF: I would definitely second that. Cherish the time you have on and off campus, and the relationships you make. You never know when you will experience something or meet someone who will impact the rest of your life. JF: The student-athlete experience is so important, helping develop a work-ethic that is unmatched. The time spent striving for perfection, being disciplined, learning from experience and more are the same tactics needed to be successful within your career and community in adulthood. TF: I still practice the skills of dedications, discipline, goal orientation, time management and teamwork in everything I do today. And those are the skills that I look for when making hires in my work environment. The opportunity to compete as a student-athlete is special and should never be taken for granted. Bakersfield, Calif. â CSU Bakersfield Swimming and Diving left the Western Athletic Conference for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation ahead of the 2020-21 swimming season. An ironic coincidence on the 10th anniversary of Bakersfieldâs inaugural MPSF season, the 2010-11 campaign, following the programâs departure from Conference USA. More than a mere footnote, the 2010-11 swimming season remains one of the most successful in program history, as a deep and experienced menâs roster burst onto the MPSF scene and ran away with the first Division I conference championship in Roadrunner history. Senior Jake Priest was named the MPSF Swimmer of the Year, winning individual league championships in the 200 Butterfly, and the 200 and 400 Individual Medleys, while swimming the lead-off leg on CSUBâs title-winning 800 Free Relay team. Peter Bardessono, Chad McKenzie, Brian Martinez, Matt Parsonage and Evan Vizcarra also one individual championships, and the `Runners swept all five relay events, cruising to the team title by nearly a 200-point margin over second-place Seattle U. Recently Priest, Bardessono and McKenzie, joined by teammates Dane Oleson and Dan Wickensheimer, shared their memories of the 2010-11 season and the connections they share to this day. CONTINUE READING BELOW... The 2010-11 Campaign was just the sixth at the Division I level for CSUB, a decorated program at the Division II level. Like most championship stories, this one began with recruitingâ¦ McKenzie: I had been swimming at a Division II school in South Carolina and CSUBâs success at that level was well established. Getting recruited to a D1 program was a goal of mine, so it was an opportunity for the best of both worlds. The added attraction was the outdoor pool and sunny weather in Bakersfield. Bardessono: Knowing CSUB had so much DII success was promising, because I knew success would be rooted in a programâs history and that my coaches, teammates and the alumni would demand success at the D1 level. Chris sold me on the idea that the team he was assembling could do big things and I knew the guys on the roster would challenge me and make me a better swimmer every day. I wouldnât have had it any other way. Wickensheimer: The simplicity of Chrisâ pitch was the most attractive part for me.Â He wanted to put together a squad of guys who were driven to continue the storied tradition of championships, but this time at the highest level of NCAA competition. Priest: We were of one mind and our goal was to be the best. It also helped put a chip on our shoulder when outsiders looked down upon us as a small school moving up from the DII level. McKenzie: The outdoor pool and sunny weather in Bakersfield, didnât hurt either! Coach Hansenâs high expectations for CSUB Swimming started coming to fruition in 2010, when the `Runners swam to a third-place finish in the conference meet, setting a tone for 2011 and the MPSFâ¦ Priest: We knew we had a fast young team at the Conference USA meet, but I think a lot of us were just excited to be there. I really leaned on our upper-class guys like, Chad (McKenzie), Matt Parsonage, and Luca Leskur - they kept us focused and grounded but also pushed us to compete. Oleson: This was my first conference championship meet, so I didnât really know what to expect. What stood out to me was the powerful connection between the team and learning from the older and faster guys what the expectations were to âfinishâ a season. They set a high standard for the rest of my college career. McKenzie: We didnât have much expectation for conference that season, other than hoping to perform our best individual and as a team, finishing third was an exciting and a launching pad for our future together. We had some great individual performances and that created an energy around our team moving forward. Bardessono: I wasnât a part of the team in 2010, but the progression I saw from 2009 to 2010 and the performance at the conference meet was a big reason why I decided to sign at CSUB. I wanted to be a part of that next wave of recruiting and hopefully one of the final pieces we needed to win a championship! Wickensheimer: After that result, we started to imagine the opportunity to be the first ever team champion in the MPSF and it was pretty exciting! We saw each other getting better every day in practice and in competition and we knew we were getting pretty good. In 2011, the team opened the season placing second at the USC Invitational against some of the top teams in the countryâ¦ Priest: I remember heading to that meet and wanting to prove to USC, Stanford and all of those schools that we weren't just fast on paper, that we were coming to compete! I knew a lot of their swimmers, especially in the 400 IM, and I hated being overlooked. Wickensheimer: The USC meet was VERY fast â and some of us younger guys on the team were still trying to get the hang of college swimming. Then Chad McKenzie set the meet record in the 100 IM and it opened a lot of our eyes. It didn't matter who was on the block next to us, we were fast too! McKenzie: USC is a powerhouse and always has some of the fastest swimmers in the World. Finishing second proved to us that we could swim with anyone. Oleson: The USC Invitational is always fun, because you get to see who stayed in shape all summer! That finish showed how dedicated we were over the summer and all the work we had put in ahead of the season. The `Runners posted a 6-3 record in duals that season, dropping three meets against Pac-12 opponents but picking up valuable experience along the wayâ¦ Bardessono: Itâs always good to get in the water against big time programs. Arizona State was a team we all had our eyes on to beat that year. Unfortunately, it didnât go our way, but I do believe that those meets really helped us find ourselves and become a championship level team. Priest: I loved and hated these meets. You want to try to win them all, but we were always in the middle of our hardest training when those matchups rolled around. We were always tired, so we didnât swim our best, but they were the perfect tune-ups for post-season swimming. Bardessono: Those meets allowed us to see how the best in the nation focus on doing the little things right. Seeing and adopting their habits helped us become the championship team we wanted to be. Oleson: This was my freshman year of college and I had played more water polo before coming to CSUB. All of a sudden, Iâm standing behind the blocks and looking over to see Olympic Rings tattooed on the guy next to me. You learn so much about racing when youâre competing against the best, even if theyâre faster than you that day. McKenzie: Standing on the block against Nathan Adrian, Tom Shields and a host of other Olympians from around the World adds a sense of the magnitude to an event. Wickensheimer: It was an incredible opportunity to race against the fastest swimmers in the country. I used those meets as a chance to observe and learn and then apply what I learned in our championship meet. McKenzie: That experience competing against such high caliber swimmers definitely instilled a confidence in us that we carried forward and gave us a lot to draw upon in our championship races. After a February 5 dual with Cal, Bakersfield had three weeks away from competition to prepare for the MPSF Championship meetâ¦ Oleson: I remember after our meet at Cal it was a long and quiet bus ride home, but this gave us time to reflect and prepare our mindset for Conference. McKenzie: We werenât competing, but it wasnât exactly three weeks off! The training load was less, and gym sessions were lighter, but we still had to get ready for a conference championship meet. Wickensheimer: It was three weeks of preparation to be our absolute best. It was a chance to rest, recover and focus on all of the little things.Â But we were also preparing for battle. Bardessono: Itâs a relief when you get a big break, especially before the biggest meet of the season. For sprinters and middle-distance guys like me, we would begin to taper off our workouts and focus on what your day-to-day routine will look like on race day. Those three weeks helped get my mind in the right spot and allowed my body to rest. Priest: It's the best time of the year for a swimmer; we focused on breaking down our races and working on splits, turns and starts - anything that would give us an edge. Heading into the Championship meet, there was only one goalâ¦ Wickensheimer: We knew we were the best team at the meet - it was all about execution at that point. McKenzie: It was simple, we wanted to win. Oleson: Since day one our goal was to win. Bardessono: Flat out, we wanted to win. Priest: We knew we could win. The `Runners got off to a fast start at the championship meet, dominating the early relays â a team strengthâ¦ Bardessono: In my view relays make all the difference in a meet and they show which team is truly the deepest and the best. As a team you can weather a poor individual swim, but one bad leg on a relay can beat you. Priest: We had an amazing line-up that season. You needed to be swimming on point, or youâd get taken off the relay teams. McKenzie: I expected us to do well in the relays. As a team we generally raised our performances when we were swimming for each other and when we put aside our own ambitions to focus on our relay finishes. Oleson: Iâm not sure we expected to win all five, but I knew we liked our chances in each race. The relays are the most exciting part of any meet and we always got up for those races. Wickensheimer: Just thinking about the relays at that meet gets my heart pumping. The whole team behind the blocks for the 200 and 400 freestyle relays is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life! Our mindset going into those races was the same it had been all season, swim fast and kick butt. Bardessono: I was especially proud of our relay success as the only individual to be on all of the wining relays. Any time Chris placed relay responsibility on me that year it meant a lot - It showed the team trusted my ability to perform under pressure. I love that type of pressure and It always brought out the best in me. As the meet dragged on, it became as much a test of will as of skill and speedâ¦ Oleson: In a typical conference championship youâll race multiple times per session and have two sessions a day, which means that while youâre swimming 8,000-10,000 yards per day when accounting for warm-up and cool down. That distance really adds up fast. It was amazing to watch the transition from the first day, where everyone is fresh, to the third, when you really get into grind of real racing. We had prepared correctly and were really able to solidify our win and out swim other teams who hadnât worked as hard all season. Bardessono: As the days wore on the fatigue started to kick and we just tried to relax and save energy. Oleson: We had prepared correctly and were able to solidify our standing late on day three, when we out swam other teams who hadnât worked as hard as we did all season. In addition to sweeping all five relay events, CSUB captured eight individual MPSF titles that weekendâ¦ Bardessono: When Jake stepped up and won the 200 IM on the second night it put a stamp on the meet and put the other teams on notice that we were here to win. Priest: my favorite race that year was the 200 IM, but Chad was just so fast in the breaststroke and I had to sprint my hardest to stay with him â I donât think I beat him that whole year in practice. McKenzie: I remember all those battles in the 200 IM! Priest: That race was my primary focus at the conference meet, and I remember feeling fast â my splits were on point and I couldn't see anyone, but I knew Chad was right with me and that we were well out in front. I could just barely see his splashes, so I knew he was close. I purposely turned toward him on the breaststroke leg, and I remember us locking eyes. We were dead equal! I grinned because this was what I trained all year! Chad was my greatest competitor that year, training with him that year made me faster and I finally got him! Wickensheimer: Jake also won the 400 IM with an amazing performance. Matt Parsonage out-touched me for gold in the 100 Fly â I remember that all but one swimmer in that entire heat was from CSUB. Bardessono: The 100 Fly stands out for me too - I was a part of the final with Dan and Matt, and Jay Jones and Michael Swartz, and I donât think I have ever been a part of a final like that in my career. We definitely dominated that event! Wickensheimer: Iâll never forget Chadâs 100 Breast performance either, he absolutely dominated that race. McKenzie: Personally, it was a bitter-sweet race, I won in a school record time, but was hoping to qualify for NCAAâs. I was incredibly proud of my performance, but ultimately, I knew it wasnât enough to get me to where I want to be. We won a few races after we knew we had won the Championship; I remember those races because it was a statement that we would never give up and never wanted to lose. Bardessono: For me the 100 Backstroke was a memorable one - I won the race with a lifetime best at that time and I had to fight off my Luka Leskur for the win. Luka was one of the best backstrokers CSUB has ever had and I came to CSUB to learn from, and compete with, him. Jake Priest would win three MPSF Championships that weekend, and as a result was named the Conference Swimmer of the Year at the conclusion of the meetâ¦ Oleson: Jake was such a fierce competitor and a fantastic athlete. One thing that always stood out about Jake was his commitment in and out of the pool - He would put the same effort into running, lifting and dry land workouts that he put into the pool. McKenzie: I was fortunate enough to compete against Jake. He was exceptionally hard working and that shone through in his performance. It was the epitome of hard work paying off. Wickensheimer: Jake's training sets made me cringe just looking at them on the board.Â That dude was an incredible athlete and the kind of guy you could put into any race and expect him to find a way to win. Bardessono: Jake was my roommate both years that I was at CSUB, and he was a really fun guy to be around, but he was also an absolute work horse. He swam a lot of events that most other guys really donât want to swim. I know we respected him for that alone. Jake was a great all-around swimmer and I think he got exactly what was coming to him that season. He earned it, I saw firsthand how disciplined he was in and out of the pool. We didnât spend our time outside of the pool on any nonsense, instead we were focused on being good students, working hard in the pool and taking care of our bodies. He worked his tail off and that hard worked showed up on championship week, when he won all of his individual races. CSUB was dominant en route to its MPSF championship, posting an astounding 647 team points and outdistancing second-place Pacific by 148 points. It was just the third Division I championship for the university and the first since the entire athletic department had made the move to college athleticsâ highest levelâ¦ McKenzie: Winning that championship was a sense of finally arriving as a DI athletic department. We were competing against the best college athletes in the country, if not the world, and we deserved to be there. Oleson: We always defined our goals at the beginning of season, and we understood what winning would mean to our school. It was a great experience to be able to show that CSUB was up to the DI transition and had come prepared. Wickensheimer: A lot of us knew, that was the first DI Championship since the move, and you can bet we wanted to be able to make that claim! I like to think that championship was a big part of what CSUB swimming has become today.Â And the programâs expectation of being a champion! Bardessono: It meant a lot to be a part of the first team to have that type of success. thought it was cool that we were able to lead the way during the transition to DI sports. It was a special thing to be a part of! Priest: It was our goal to win conference from the beginning and I wasnât at all surprised that we accomplished our goal so quickly. We knew the school had the potential to be a DI threat and we wanted to lead that effort. There is always something special about being a part of a collegiate team, but even more so when you share in the joy of winning a championshipâ¦ Wickensheimer: I think being part of a college team is the greatest experience someone can have. My bond with my teammates is for life, and that goes for everyone who was there with us. For the most part, we all still are a part of each other's lives today. McKenzie:Â I think the bond is there regardless of a championship, but it definitely helps improve the relationships as the win was a culmination of all the work we endured as a team. Seeing that work pay off for all of us was an amazing experience. Preist: We were brothers then and we are brothers know. The championship didn't help create our bond. Our bond helped create that championship. Oleson: I always say that my decision to swim in college was the fourth best decision Iâve made in my life, behind only my faith in God, marrying my wife and deciding to have our child. My wife was also a CSUB swimmer and we met on that pool deck. Winning a championship definitely strengthened our bond, but it was always there. I still keep in touch with a majority of that team to this day! Bardessono: I started in the sport really late, around age 14, and Iâd had high levels of individual success but had never really been a part of a winning team in swimming. Swimming is such an individual sport at times, that I think people lose sight of how much of a team game it really can be. You wake up at crazy hours of the morning to get into a freezing pool and go through some really difficult workouts. You dream that all of the time youâre putting in will mean raising a trophy at the end of the year and when you go through something like that with a group of guys, youâre going to create a special bond. Two of the guys on that championship team, Evan Vizcarra and Mark Silvius, were groomsman in my wedding. Those bonds donât just disappear. McKenzie: Itâs always easy to reflect on the good times, but I also reflect on the difficult times because those difficult times lay the foundation for success. In swimming, everyone hurts, and everyone goes through the workouts and the cold walks to the pool. Itâs being together and enduring together that makes the team a special group. Without teammates, the training doesnât get done and the championship doesnât happen. Oleson: The guys taught me how to compete, how to race and how to be a part of a team. I wouldnât have been as successful in my swimming career, or since, without going through that process with this special group and learning those lessons! Bardessono: I think our team really bonded during our training camp â I had never been through a training camp like that before, we were just getting hammered in the pool every day, and one practice in particular Iâll never forget. We were so beat, and Chris knew we were beat, but after practice he asked for three volunteers to step up and swim one more 200 Freestyle under two minutes. No one stepped up, so I volunteered along with Jake and our team captain Vance â and we all made it! But Chris was disappointed that only three of us had volunteered â and only after we realized we needed to volunteer. He had expected us to be hungry and meet the challenge. The next day was supposed to be an off day, but he adjusted our schedule and brought us right back to the pool. At the time, I remember we were all so angry. We talked as a team following that second practice and realized what he was trying to accomplish. He knew that a four-day championship meet wouldnât be easy and was preparing us to step up and push through the pain. We decided from then on we would always step up for our teammates. It brought us closer together and forged the bonds for our successful season, more importantly It forged those bonds for life. Iâll never forget that practice, or that team. ANDIE EASLEY | @CSUB_WBB | FEBRUARY 11, 2021 CSUB's Athletic Communications staff recently exchanged emails with Andie Easley for a discussion on the 2020-21 Roadrunner Basketball season, their first year in the Big West Conference, the difficulties of playing through a pandemic, a new atmosphere at the Icardo Center and her team and individual goals for 2021. CONTINUE READING BELOW... How unique has this season been and how has it effected your preparation before and during the season? This season has been entirely different than any previous season and the biggest difference is the uncertainty of any future games or practices. Each game feels more like a gift than a guarantee and its helped us to focus on what we can control and what is right in front of us. I definitely had to prepare more on my own this off-season and throughout the pre-season. We didnât have access to the gym or the school for most of the off-season and when we did our time was limited. I did a lot of individual training at home and isolated in the safe locations, so I could stay healthy and do my part. What have been the biggest challenges this season and how do you stay positive when so much is out of your control? First and foremost, Iâm staying positive because I know that God is in control of our entire situation and He will never fail us. I try to remind myself often that this year is a bonus year and a chance for us to work hard to get better and at the end of the year we all get a season back from the NCAA. I am grateful we get to play basketball at all. The biggest challenge has been to stay healthy as a team. We are extremely careful to stay in our own âbubbleâ. We canât take any risks that might put our season in jeopardy, which has been hard because that includes seeing friends and family. More than anything, I have learned not to take this opportunity we have to play college basketball for granted. With the uncertainty surrounding this season how hard was it to stay positive? What did it feel like when you were finally able to take the court with your team? The uncertainty was frustrating at times because we werenât always sure what we were preparing for. I knew we would eventually play basketball again, so I placed all of my time and energy into my preparation during quarantine and that consistency kept me focused on what mattered. It was really exciting when we finally got to play, but it also felt like a brand-new experience because of how different things are this season. We've had to adapt to quite a bit this year, but just being on the court has helped a lot in these uncertain times. One of the biggest changes has been playing with out fans in the stands. How does that change the environment in the Icardo Center? Playing in this new environment has been extremely different. Not having the energy and encouragement that our fans normally bring to the Icardo Center has been a challenge. It's one we are still learning to overcome. I miss that energy, especially when momentum is against us and we used to be able to count on that boast from our fans. I also miss the love and support the fans, the community and our friends and families brought to every game. What would you say to the fans that wish they could be there it watch you play in person? I would want them to know that we appreciate their continued support through other avenues this season, and we cannot wait to see you back at the Icardo when the times comes! Without the support you are used to with fans in the stands, where have you turned for support when you need it? My family provides me with an incredible support system. I have family in both Phoenix and Bakersfield who support and encourage me unconditionally. I cannot thank them enough and their support has been priceless throughout these challenging times. What were your team and individual goals coming into this season? Did they change at all due to the circumstances? Our ultimate team goal is always to win a championship. This season called for added goals due to the pandemic and playing our first year in the Big West Conference. We want to prove to the league that we are a great team and can be competitive for a Big West Title. Most of all we want to stay healthy and keep playing basketball! My personal goal this season was to be a leader on our team and fill whatever role we is needed to put the team in the best position to win each game. I want to stay healthy and be there for my team for the entire season. How would you assess the team's performance to date? Iâm proud of what the team has accomplished thus far given the circumstances of this season. We are always evaluating our performances and, of course, we feel like we should have won a few more games. However, we have taken each loss as a learning experience and grown as a team. We have a lot more we want to show our Big West opponents! What does the team need to focus on down the stretch to put yourself in a position for success and prepare yourselves for the Big West Tournament? I wholeheartedly believe we are capable of winning a Big West championship this season, but in order to accomplish that goal we need to bring our best energy to every game we play. This team absolutely has the necessary talent, skill and competitive spirit. We will be in a great place heading into the conference tournament if we continue to work hard to stay consistent (especially with our energy) and play together for our one common goal. CAROL BENKE | @CSUB_Volleyball | January 21, 2021 Dear Reader, I am going to dive you deep into my crazy story and show you that we always have something to be grateful for, even in our darkest days. I will show you that it is never too late to follow your dreams and it is worth it to never give up on them. It seems like it was yesterday when I first touched a volleyball. I was nine years old, and all I wanted was to be a super skillful player just like my sister was. I fell in love with volleyball in a matter of seconds, and there was nobody who could take it away from me. My mom always worried about letting me go alone â and so young â to my volleyball practices, but she knew this sport always molded the happiest version of Carol Benke. CONTINUE READING BELOW... When I turned 14 my dreams became a bit bigger. I wanted to play volleyball at a higher level than my little town could provide, which made me want to go to Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil (My home country). My mom cried when she saw me leaving her arms and waiving from the bus window, but my dad reminded her that dreams can only be reached if we are brave enough to follow them - and this is what I was doing. I followed my dreams and I never really thought about all the challenges I would face going into this crazy adventure. My dreams outweighed my fear, and this was just the beginning. I was a country girl, so everything was so new and exciting for me. I was used to having my mom drive me to school every day, but I was now taking public buses and subways to get to my high school. Thankfully, I got a new family in Sao Paolo, who helped me get through all the new difficulties I faced. Believe me, if you are good to all people around you, this goodness will surely come back to you â sometimes twice as much! It was difficult to find Under-18 teams with good resources in Brazil, especially if they were a government program. In my case, resources were very scarce. We only had two volleyball nets, and one of them was solely used on game days because it was not torn. Our balls were pretty old too, but it did not mean anything to the hardworking, passionate group I was blessed to play with. We did not have our own room or a private bathroom. In fact, I lived with six girls in a 10 x 10 foot room, but it only made every single day more fun than I would have ever imagined. The girls on my team, and their passion for volleyball, made this experience even more special. This environment gave me friends for life and allowed me to have some of the most memorable moments of my life. It showed me that if we were going through tough situations, at the end of the day, we could always rely on each other. I learned to enjoy the little things in life, and I realized that good friends will always be your family away from home. After high school, I knew that staying in Brazil meant I would have to choose between playing volleyball at a high level or pursuing a degree at a university. The opportunity to play volleyball and pursue a degree abroad was indescribable. I decided to come to the United States to follow both my dreams and, oh boy, I dived deep into this one without second thoughts. First stop: Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida. It wasnât easy, that I can tell you! Walking into a whole different culture, speaking a new language, being far away from those you love the most and having difficulties understanding what other people were saying were only a few challenges of the journey. I was made fun of A LOT, but my dad always told me, âjust embrace the jokes, and know that this is part of the process.â Today, I can look back and laugh about the times I couldnât understand what my coach was telling me that first season. All I really knew was that he wanted me to give my all each game for the ladies who were playing by my side. This is what I did. I gave my all every single match. You might find yourself lost sometimes, but I assure you that if you give your best each day and you are true to yourself, things will work out and you will find yourself again. In the middle of this chaos, I found comfort because I realized how worthwhile it was for me. I met so many wonderful people, I was coached by wise men and women, I traveled to places that I had never dreamed of visiting and, most importantly, I grew so much as an athlete and a human being. And when I thought I could never ask for more, God brought me to CSUB, and a new family full of wonderful people. Who would have guessed that Carol Benke would be able to reach her deepest dream and play at the Division I level!? Yet there I was, reaching another dream. Since the very first day I stepped on campus, I knew CSUB was the right place for me. CSUB is not only home to an amazing volleyball program in the NCAAâs top division. CSUB is family, respect, honesty, hard work, compassion and my teammates and coaches who remind me of those values every single day. I feel so blessed to be a part of this family, and for being so welcomed by them. Certainly, there are many more obstacles I will face in my college career, both academically and athletically. But what I always remind myself is that the process is wonderful in so many aspects and very rewarding in the end. No matter how hard some situations might be, just remember the song that says, âwhat does not kill you, makes you stronger.â Remind yourself of how great you are, of how special your dreams are and to never give up on those dreams. Remember that hard days will come, but you will never go through them alone. You will learn so much and you will be grateful for those lessons. Trust me, following your dream will always be worth it at the end. I hope this simple letter will touch your heart and revive that dream that you thought might be impossible in your heart. Love, Caroline Molossi Benke P.S. Nothing is impossible when YOU make it possible! DANIEL CARRIZOSA | @CSUB.Baseball | December 15, 2020 Dear Daniel, Youâre probably running around a sports complex at your sister's softball tournament or playing a pick-up sports with random kids. You used to play all day long, until your dad would whistle from across the complex letting you know it was time to come home. Even then you hated to stop, begging him to let you take one more pitch or finish one more playâ¦ For you, itâs just the beginning. Youâll grow up playing all kinds of different sports, but for some reason, youâre going to fall in love with one of the hardest games in the world. Baseball. Being on the diamond is natural for you. Mom wonât be happy about all the blinds and windows youâre going to break playing baseball inside the house, but donât worry because there is nothing a little super glue can't fix! A few broken windows will be a small sacrifice for the sport you love and the sport that will end up giving you so much happiness and opportunity. CONTINUE READING BELOW... You might not believe this yet, but youâre going to play Division I college baseball in California, at CSU Bakersfield. Not only that, baseball will give you the opportunity to graduate with a degree in biology and a chance to pursue a Ph.D. Itâs not going to be an easy road, by any means, and youâre going to deal with so many obstacles throughout your journey. Youâll face adversity at every turn. So many people will tell you that you arenât smart enough, that you canât hit a breaking ball, that your fielding isnât good enough or that youâll never make it at the DI level. And itâs going to hurt. At times, you might even start to believe them, but donât! Just remember to smile, put your head down and work to prove them wrong. Never be satisfied. You need to be the hardest worker on and off the field, because, as the saying goes, hard work beats talent when talent doesnât work hard. Family means everything to you. They are your biggest fans, but theyâre also going to be your biggest critics and theyâll rarely hold anything back. Understand it comes from a place of support, learn from it and always keep moving forward. When you donât play well and Dad turns off the radio, forcing you to ride home from California to Arizona in silence, understand he has always be your number one supporter and only wants you to do the mental work you need to get better......and not to chase that curveball in the dirt! Your family is doing anything and everything to ensure you have the opportunity to be successful. Mom will work twelve-hour night shifts and still make it to your doubleheader at 8:30 the next morning. Dad will be working around the country, but no matter where he is, heâll never miss a game. Your sisters will be your biggest role models; pay close attention to how they handle their business because as you grow up youâre going to want to be just like them. Never take that support for granted. Your family will have a significant role in all of your development. Thank them for everything they did for you as often as you can, because youâll never be able to repay them. And call your parents regularly because they miss you, a lot. Baseball is going to consistently challenge you, embrace it. Dad will put you on an 18U travel team at 13 years old. Buckle up! The guys have full beards and weigh twice your size, but the beautiful thing about baseball is that no matter your age or your size, all that matters is whether or not you can play. Youâre going to enjoy competing with the older guys because nobody expects much from the only middle-schooler on the field. As a freshmen in high school youâre going to be thrown to the wolves as the varsity shortstop. It will feel overwhelming, but donât worry you can handle it. I promise. You might even catch the eyes of some college recruiters. Boom! All of sudden youâre getting letters from schools from all over the country. Youâre on top of the world, but donât let it get to your head. Youâve made it this far as a result of your humility and your work ethic, so keep working hard and know you arenât promised anything. Donât be afraid of making a mistake, either. Youâre going to strike out and make errors. Thatâs baseball. Donât let the appearance of college coaches and scouts get into your head. My biggest advice to you is simple; be yourself and donât try to be someone that youâre not. When youâre traveling the country visiting college campuses remember one thing â the schools may have amazing facilities and every kind of gear you can imagine, but itâs all about the connection you have with the coaches and how they will help you grow into a better student, athlete and human being. Pay attention to your feelings and trust your gut, theyâll never steer you wrong. In this case, theyâll lead you to California State University, Bakersfield. For the first time in your life, youâre going to be living on your own. College is a brand new chapter in your life, bringing with it a lot of freedoms and a lot of new responsibilities. Start watching the Food Network, because youâll have to cook for yourself from now on! Getting to college is a huge accomplishment. One of your dreams has come true! Still, I canât congratulate you yet, because youâre just getting started. Before we talk baseball, I need you to understand something. The first word in âstudent-athleteâ is the most important word and your academics need to comes first. Challenge yourself and donât procrastinate. School will be hard, get used to it, but it will all be worth it. There will be times when you stay up late studying for an exam and still have to wake up at 5:00 in the for morning weights. Welcome to college. The education youâll receive will set you up for the future and without the right grades there will be no baseball. Talk to your professor as often as you can, make sure they know your name and sit in the first couple rows for lectures. As an athlete, youâre going to have to work harder than a normal student. Professors will hold you to a higher standard. Work on those relationships. Theyâre human and their job isnât to fail you. They want the best for you and theyâre going to push you just like your coaches would on the field. The Kegley Center is a huge resource and one of the coolest spots on campus. Take advantage of the academic support found there, as well as the opportunity to study and socialize with your fellow student-athletes. Your experience won't be easy, but it will It will only be positive if you embrace learning and improvement. It's your responsibility to leave CSUB better than you found it. Being a freshman is an experience full of anticipation and a bit of anxiety. You wonât know exactly what to expect and you might feel overwhelmed by the four full years of college ahead of you. However, I need to tell you something about college and college baseball: It goes fast! When you first take the field you're going to think youâre a lot better than you are. Guess what kid, everyone is good now! Your new teammates were also the best players on their high school teams. Everyone can hit, field, run and defend. Youâre not special here. You wont get anywhere based on your high school accolades. No one cares about those accomplishments once you get to college. No one cares about your summer ball stats, your recruiting process or what other schools were interested in you. College baseball is simple: the best guys are going to play. Learn to adjust and adjust quickly. When the coaches come down on you, donât take it personally. There will be times when you feel like youâre not doing anything right or that youâre being picked on, but your coaches only want the best for you and the team. They know what type of player youâre capable of becoming. Take advantage of the weight room; the strength coach needs to be your best friend. Lifting and conditioning is another way to separate yourself. Everyone wants to be a starter, but whether you are willing to train like one when no one is watching determines how good you will be. The best part about being a college athlete will be all of the different people youâll meet and all the experiences youâll have on campus. Youâre going to make lifelong friends and create so many memories. Go to all of the sporting events you can, and cheer on your fellow student-athletes! Youâll know better than anyone how much work they put into their sports and to represent CSUB. Just make sure that baseball always wins the Rowdy Run! Traveling as a team will be another favorite part of playing baseball at CSUB. Youâll visit places youâve never been before and do so with your best friends. Enjoy the trips and take pictures of all the new places youâll go. Some of your best memories will come from these bus rides and airplane travel and playing in different stadiums will be one of the greatest experiences of your young life. Ignore those rowdy opposing fans and enjoy the moments! While were on the subject, put your social media accounts on private during the season because some fans will do anything they can to get under your skin. Although, sometimes youâll simply have to give them credit where credit is due, because they can be creative and downright funny at times. On and off the field, you should get comfortable leading by example. One day youâll be given the honor of being named team captain. Itâs an incredible responsibility but nothing truly changes. Just continue to be yourself and always put the team first. Find ways to give your teammates the confidence they need when theyâre struggling. Everyone needs someone they can talk to when things go south, and teamâs need open communication to make sure everyone is on the same page. Itâs your responsibility to leave CSUB better off than when you found it! Your time as a Roadrunner will always rank among the best years of your life. Your experience wonât always be easy, but it will only be positive if you embrace learning and improvement. Youâll be molded by every experience. Youâll fail, so that you can truly know what you're made of. And you will succeed beyond your wildest dreams! Time flies and it will be over before you know it, so enjoy every single moment and take advantage of every opportunity youâre given to get an education and play the sport you love. Good luck DC! Sincerely, Daniel Carrizosa P.S. Always have plenty of sour patch kids and sunflower seeds in your bag. Youâll thank me later! Mikayla Popham | @CSUB_Swim | December 3, 2020 Two years ago, I made the biggest decision of my young life, and moved to the US from my home in Australia. I made the move because in Australia, opportunities in the sport of swimming are extremely limited after high school. The more I explored my options, the more the opportunity to pursue both an education and further my swimming career in the United States appealed to me. It wasnât easy to find a school. I was halfway around the world and couldnât take recruiting trips. And I knew adjusting to a new level of education and swimming, on top of moving to a new country and a different culture would be a tremendous challenge. It was never easy, but the support system I found at CSUB quickly made Bakersfield my new home, away from homeâ¦ CONTINUE READING BELOW... That thing that made swimming in America appealing to me, was the team aspect of competing for CSU Bakersfield. Back home, swimming is more of an individual sport. I swam for my local club team, but the primary focus revolved around your individual performance and your personal goals. In college swimming the focus is the teamâs performance. Your success is the teamâs success and the groupâs successes are also your successes. I absolutely loved this, and for me this was a massive selling point. As I said before, my recruitment process was different from most others. I had to communicate with coaches through video chats. I wasnât able to meet with my potential teammates either and I was lucky if I could find some to communicate with on social media. Additionally, I had also never been to the United States before and I really didnât know a lot about the country in general. This made the whole process a little scary and intimidating, but I knew it was worth pursuing. CSUB stood out to me immediately. After talking to the coaches and getting the chance to speak with some of the swimmers on the team, I knew this team was one big family. It was exactly what I was hoping to find when I started the recruiting process. I also loved that the school was in California, had both a menâs and womenâs swim team and that the coaches were truly invested in helping their student-athletes to be their best selves. These were the reasons I chose CSUB, and as soon as I arrived and met the team, I knew I had made the right decision. Popham excelled as a young swimmer in Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. She'll return home this summer to compete for a spot on the Australian Olympic Swim Team, ahead of the delayed 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Still, it was a huge adjustment moving far away from home. Moving away to college is a big adjustment for any student-athlete. I knew it would take time to get settled in a new school and as part of a new team, let alone a whole new country. There were lots of little things that I didn't understand when I first arrived in America and it took me a while to get fully comfortable. I remember the first time I tried to fill up my car with gas and learned I had to pay for the gas first. It seems silly, but in Australia we fill up the car and then pay. It was the little things like this that provided the biggest culture shock. I also had some early trouble communicating, which seems strange since we speak the same language - but there are so many different words that we use for different things in Australia. When I would say something, everyone would look at me as if I was crazy. For example, what you would call a hoodie, I called a jumper. back home a trash can is a rubbish bin, we call swimsuits, togs and gasoline, petrol. It has been interesting to learn all of the things we say differently. I'm still learning new ones everyday! There were lots of little things that I didn't understand when I first arrived in America and it took me a while to get fully comfortable. It was (those) little things that provided the biggest culture shock! The most difficult time to be so far away from home was definitely around Christmas and the holidays. It was the first Christmas that I hadn't been able to spend with my family and I really missed all of the traditions and the things we would have done together. I was lucky enough to be invited home with one of my teammates to spend the holidays with their family. I will be forever grateful to them, it helped so much to be around a family on Christmas Day. They have become my American family and I feel super lucky to have them in my life, because they made my transition a whole lot easier. I am extremely lucky to have such a large support system, including my family, our team and their families and our coaches. I couldn't have done this without all of them. I felt like a welcome part of the CSUB family the moment I arrived in the States. I knew that I had so many people I could talk to and who supported me, and as a result Bakersfield felt like home in no time. It also helped me to know that my family in Australia was constantly supporting me from a far. Whether our meets were scheduled early in the morning or in the middle of the night their time, I knew they were watching and cheering for me every time I raced. A freestyle specialist, Popham also swam medley and backstroke events during her freshman season at CSUB. I'll never forget the first meet that I competed in as a member of the CSUB Swimming & Diving team. We were competing against Southern California, the University of Virginia, UC San Diego and so many more great teams. I was so nervous. This was my first college meet and I wanted to swim my best for CSUB, but as soon as we walked onto the pool deck as a team, I knew that I was a part of something bigger. It instantly made me less nervous and even more motivated to do my absolute best. This was my first experience racing as part of a team and I realized what what CSUB Swimming truly meant to me and my new life in America. That whole day I donât remember anyone sitting down to relax. If you werenât racing, warming up or warming down you were poolside cheering for your teammates. I absolutely loved that feeling. Our conference meet was another memorable moment. Walking onto the pool deck and the feeling of team support, in that atmosphere and on such an important stage, is something I will always remember. The meet wasn't easy and we faced many setbacks, including getting to swim just once instead of twice. However, the way the the team handled it and overcame all of the obstacles we faced made me extremely proud to be a Roadrunner. (Editors note: Popham excelled in the face of adversity winning Western Athletic Conference Championships in the 200 Free, the 500 Free and as a member of the 400 Free Relay team. She added a runner-up finish in the 100 Free and was named the Conference's Freshman of the Year for 2020.) I learned very early in my time at CSUB that the team should always be the first priority. Our conference experience cemented this and every training session we pushed each other harder and harder. We knew at the end of a hard session that everyone had put in their best effort. It was being a part of this team that motivated me every day. The team aspect of swimming was new to me, but it's something that has made me a better athlete and a better person. Popham capped a strong freshman season with three WAC Championships and the WAC Female Freshman of the Year Award. I'm so excited for the future with CSUB. We are moving into the Mountain-Pacific Sports Federation this season and we are all very excited. The new conference is going to challenge us, and I canât wait to get back to competing with my team and see what we can do. COVID-19 had made it hard to visualize what the future has in store for our team, but when it is safe to get back to racing I think it would be amazing to see our team to place in the top-three at this year's MPSF Championship meet in our debut season. I think this is a great goal for our team. If continue to grow as a group and focus on the incredible team culture that we have created then this is most definitely an achievable and realistic goal. Deciding to swim at the collegiate level, in America and at CSUB, has caused me to grow in countless ways. I have learned the importance of being a part of a team and supporting others and in the process I have gained a second family and a second home. My teammates and coaches, as well as the experience, has taught me a number of lessons that I will use to overcome adversity in my future. I've also rediscovered my love for the sport of swimming here in Bakersfield, and I am certainly thankful to the CSUB Swimming & Diving team for that fact! Carlos Armendariz | @CSUB_Football | November 19, 2020 I fell in love with soccer at four years old. Soccer is a family sport and nearly everyone in my family plays the game. Having a ball at my feet felt normal immediately, and I loved taking one with me wherever I went. As I grew up, I watched my dad play and realized that I also wanted to pursue the dream of playing professionally. My primary goals growing up were to keep playing soccer and to get an education. I decided my best path in the sport was through college athletics, where I would have the chance to advance both my athletic and academic careers. CSUB stood out to me right away. After visiting campus, I quickly fell in love with the university and I knew that CSUB would be my new home. I expected to make an impact my freshman season and play a significant role for the team. Like any other freshman, I was confident and excited about playing at the next level. I wanted to be someone my teammates and coaches could trust to help the team, but when the year started and the line-ups solidified, I wasnât one of those players. In fact, I wasnât playing much at all and it hurt... CONTINUE READING BELOW... At first, I felt sorry for myself. This was the first time in my life that I was not receiving major playing time. I had come from a successful soccer academy where I played all of the time. The natural transition from high school to college only made things more difficult. Initially, I didnât react well, but as the season went on, I came to my senses and realized that I wasnât going to get the playing time I wanted unless I changed my attitude. I quickly turned myself around, tried to embrace my role and do all I could to be there for my team. Although I still wasnât playing much, I was able to encourage my teammates and give my all during training. Training was my chance to play hard and help my teammates prepare for the opposition each weekend. At the end of each session, I would stay on the field and do extra work because doing the minimum hadnât been helping me. I knew I needed to do more. Armendariz (center) made just 3 appearances in 2019, playing 38 minutes and registering one shot on goal. When I met with the coaches at the end of the season, we discussed what went wrong for me during my freshman season. We talked about what I needed to work on to get on the field. Still, I left the meeting pretty happy because it was clear they trusted me to come back as a different version of myself. As I looked back on my freshman season, I knew I did not want to have a repeat of that experience as a sophomore. I didnât want to let my teammates or coaches, my family or myself, down again. My focus was set on doing the work and having a better opportunity the next fall. In a lot of ways, my freshman year was one to forget, but I also took it as a lesson that not everything is going to be perfect and sometimes things need to change. I thought a lot about my family that Spring. All the late-night drives to training and games, etc. I am lucky to have parents that support me in everything I do. Even through my first season at CSUB, they always found ways to encourage me to work harder and not give up. I went home that Winter with one thing on my mind, to have a much better Spring semester. I had to change a lot to better myself. I started with my diet. I was careful about what I ate and drank. Diet is one of the most critical things that one needs in this sport. Additionally, my fitness level needed to get a lot better. Fitness is a big part of collegiate soccer and having the ability to keep going late in the game can really separate you from the pack. I would go on long runs through my neighborhood. The best way to gain endurance is through running; thatâs no secret. Playing games during the Winter break also helped me a lot. Having that game feel is something every player needs, and I noticed improvement in myself right away. Simply changing my diet and elevating my fitness had me feeling lean, lighter, and physically fit. That summer, I decided to stay in Bakersfield, workout at CSUB, and get myself accustomed to the local weather. The Summer workouts, with teammates who had also stayed, was another turning point for me. I also talked more with the coaching staff, and knowing they continued to have faith in me heading into the Fall was something I took to heart. I always want the best for this program. All I ever want to do is win for CSUB. After all of my heard work in the off-season I felt confident that I could make a difference and help our team leave the Western Athletic Conference on a high note. I received a huge vote of confidence when I was selected as a team captain ahead of the season. I had wanted to be a player that my teammates looked up to for my work ethic and my love for our program; and now I was one. I also knew my hard work and improvement hadnât gone unnoticed. After barely seeing the field my freshman season, I started all 19 games and led the team in minutes played as a sophomore. Most importantly, I was in a position to help lead our team in pursuit of our goals. The success I had was a direct result of all the work that I put in during summer. Iâm proud of my individual success, but Iâm most proud of everything we accomplish together as a team. Our goal was to win the WAC, and while we had a tough loss in the semi-finals it hit me on the flight back from Colorado that this was a good year for the program. I felt a sense of pride knowing that this program is moving forward, and I am able to be a part of it. Armendariz started all 19 games in 2019, finishing third on the team with four goals and eight points. Enduring the transition from my freshman season to my sophomore year, I learned that not everything will go as planned. There will always be adversity to overcome and you must be ready to handle any obstacle that gets in your way. Itâs important to stay mentally strong. Your mind can start to take you to dark places, that will only bring you down, but you must find a way to be tough minded, fight back and work hard. Nothing is ever given, no matter what youâve accomplished in the past. My freshman year made more mature and I learned that hard work is the key to anything you do in life. It is the hard work you put in when nobody is watching, that will shine when you are out there on the field. Heading into my Junior and Senior seasons, I will keep working hard and pushing myself to my limits. I know the challenges, the opposition and what I need to do to compete at this level. These are the things you donât always understand until later in your career. My advice to freshmen making the adjustment from club to college soccer, is to make sure you report fit. Keeping up with the older players and earning the trust of your teammates and coaches is critical. If you arenât getting much playing time, donât dwell on that fact or feel bad about yourself. Pick yourself up, do extra work and give your teammates everything you have. Our coaches always tell us we, âcan be mad, sad, or whatever (we) are feeling for 23 hours of the day, but when we are working together for that one hour, give the team your all.â This reminds us that the team counts on each one of us for success, and we cannot just go through the motions. COVID-19 has prevented us from being able to play a competitive game for more than a year, but this is another chance to get better in the face of adversity and close any gaps in our game. Every team is facing the pandemic and the playing field is level. The responsibility lies with us and how hard we are willing to work during a difficult time. The struggles Iâve faced in my career and the work I had to do to improve have prepared me for this. I would not change my experience for anything. The obstacles I had to face made me the player and person I am today. Transitioning to the Big West Conference is a big test, but I believe our team is ready. The goals we set do not change because we are moving to a different conference. Like an excited freshman, we want to make an immediate impact in the Big West and move the needle forward for this program. This time, I know weâve done the work. Seleisa Elisaia |Â @CSUB_Volleyball | November 2, 2020 I am voting in tomorrow's election because this is how my voice can be heard for the betterment of this country. Our nation needs change and this is my chance to be a part of that. Being in control of my own future lies within the power of voting. Two years ago, having just graduated from high school, I didn't understand the difference I could make by choosing to vote. It is easy to feel ashamed by not voting when you first turn eighteen, but it is never too late to educate yourself and register to vote. Our nation is facing many different challenges, and I've come to a realization that my voice and my actions can make a difference for the better. In a time of uncertainty, it is important to ensure that we have leaders who will positively affect our future. By casting my vote for the first time it means taking part in a step toward justice. It's important to exercise your right to vote because it is how we ensure our concerns are being heard. When it comes to advocating for change, there is no action as powerful as casting a vote. I am voting tomorrow, because it matters now more than ever. CONTINUE READING BELOW... Daniel Carrizosa hit a team-best .343 with three doubles and four runs batted in during an abbreviated 2020 campaign. I am looking forward to voting in my first presidential election. There is so much going on in the United States right now and the elected president will have a direct impact on how those issues affect all Americans. It's so important for us, as US Citizens, to do our part and exercise our right to vote. Voting is a privilege and its not something we can continue to take for granted. Daniel Carrizosa | @CSUB.Baseball Center Vanessa Austin enters her senior season with 699 career points, on 52.5-percent shooting, and 429 rebounds. Voting has been an important issue for me since my eighteenth birthday. It's important because it is an opportunity to use my voice and speak on the issues that directly effect my life. Not only does voting allow us to use our voices, it is how we can make a difference in our society. Voting and speaking on these issues is also an opportunity for me to honor all of the women who have fought for my right to vote, especially women of color. Vanessa Austin | @CSUB_WBB Seniors Alix Neilan (above) and Sydney Garvy will captain the 2020-21 Women's Swimming & Diving Team. This election may be one of the most important moments we have experienced in our young lives. Iâm looking forward to voting because it is one of the most influential ways we can use our voices to promote change, both across the country and in our own communities. One of my favorite quotes is from Susan B. Anthony - ' Someone struggled for your right to vote, so use it.' This is our chance to voice what is important to us as an American people. But, in order for that voice to be heard, we must show up and vote! Alix Neilan | @CSUB_Swim I see voting as my way to stand up for, and speak out about, what I believe in. I'm looking forward to voting tomorrow, because I would like to see changes made in our country. I believe that everyone has a right to feel protected, heard and valued. Voting is an important responsibility because it helps the government best represent its people. Voting goes beyond participating in a presidential election; it also encompasses propositions that affect our daily activities, representatives who facilitate civic progress and judges rule on important social issues. Voting is how we make a difference. Sydney Garvy | @CSUB_Swim Carlos Armendariz started all 19 contests during his sophomore season, scoring three goals and serving as a team captain. Voting is so important for both me and my family. It is one of the most impactful ways that we can use our voice in hopes of bringing about change we believe in. Many think that one vote won't make a difference, but it absolutely does. I encourage everyone to vote, use their voice and make a difference. Carlos Armendariz | @CSUB_Football I am voting because that's what it means to be an American. Voting is the best chance for my voice to be heard and I take that responsibility very seriously. Jarrod Snyder | @CSUB_Wrestling Senior Bianca Frausto set personal best times in the mile, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, and 10,000m races last season. I vote because I know how important it is to use my voice and I know many people who do not have the same privilege. Angela Davis once said, 'I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I'm changing the things I cannot accept.' There are many ways we can create change. I believe that I can do my part by voting; and so can you. Every vote matters. Bianca Frausto | @CSUB_Womens_Track @CSUB_Swim | October 30, 2020 Hello, âRunner Nation! My name is Kristofer M. Rogic and I am the President of CSU Bakersfieldâs Student-Athlete Advisory Committee. I am proud to work with a very talented and hardworking team of student-athletes and staff here at CSUB, as well as being a leader in communicating and organizing events and initiatives with other SAAC members across the Big West Conference. Being a student-athlete at CSUB has opened so many doors for me and has given me opportunities that were once unimaginable. Coming to this community, so far from home, was one of the best decisions I have ever made, but I never knew I would be able to achieve so much. I owe so much thanks to the tremendous athletic staff we have at CSUB, and to all of my teammates and coaches. CONTINUE READING BELOW... Hello, âRunner Nation! My name is Kristofer M. Rogic and I am the President of CSU Bakersfieldâs Student-Athlete Advisory Committee. I am proud to work with a very talented and hardworking team of student-athletes and staff here at CSUB, as well as being a leader in communicating and organizing events and initiatives with other SAAC members across the Big West Conference. Rogic, a native of Zagreb, Croatia, is a six-time Croatian National Champion and has represented CSUB in International competitions around the World, including the 2019 World Championships in Seoul, South Korea. Being a student-athlete at CSUB has opened so many doors for me and has given me opportunities that were once unimaginable. Coming to this community, so far from home, was one of the best decisions I have ever made, but I never knew I would be able to achieve so much. I owe so much thanks to the tremendous athletic staff we have at CSUB, and to all of my teammates and coaches. \"People may know us best as hardworking individuals, who put our blood, sweat and tears into the process of achieving our goals, but we are more than just student-athletes.\" Without a doubt, this year has been a challenge in so many ways. However, it is our duty as âRunners to make the best of things, no matter the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Weâve learned that communication and engagement are two important aspects of any team and any athletic program, and that keeping the end goal in mind is crucial, whether we are practicing on campus or training at home. With that in mind, I strongly believe that with continued hard work and discipline, we can look forward to all of our teams practicing at full capacity, and excelling in competition, again very soon. People may know us best as hardworking individuals, who put our blood, sweat and tears into the process of achieving our goals, but we are more than just Student-Athletes. A key part of CSUBâs Four Pillars of Development model revolves around consistently creating an environment in which all student-athletes feel at home on our campus. For those reasons, it is important to give everyone a chance to speak out about any of the issues they might face or experience. A backstroke specialist, Rogic also competes in the Individual Medley (above) and has been a critical piece of CSUB's relay teams since 2017. He's a 10-Time All-Conference honoree and holds school records in seven different events. Today, CSUB is launching a new outlet for student-athletes called, THE MARATHON, which will provide `Runner student-athletes with a platform to express themselves regarding their athletic and academic careers, their aspirations and reflections, their opinions on the world around us and so much more. THE MARATHON will help all of us stay on track in our development and maintain the close-knit culture that we have built here in Bakersfield. We all know how important it is to stay involved in our community, and to support and inspire others. I encourage you all to join us by reading THE MARATHON and helping us to use our voice in making a difference. Sincerely, Kristofer M Rogic Appreciate Terms of Service Privacy Policy Report Abuse"

For outdoor events (Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Baseball, & Softball), CSUB students with and without ID may claim their ticket at the mobile box office, often referred to as the \"Ticket Trailer.\" Footer © 2023 CSU Bakersfield Athletics Terms of Service , opens in new window Privacy Policy , opens in new window Accessibility Learfield, opens a new window Sidearm Sports Learfield, opens a new window Ad Blocker Detected Thanks for visiting !

Learn more Frequently Asked Questions Expand All | Collapse All Why are software updates necessary? Microsoft is committed to providing its customers with software that has been tested for safety and security. Although no system is completely secure, we use processes, technology, and several specially focused teams to investigate, fix, and learn from security issues to help us meet this goal and to provide guidance to customers on how to help protect their PCs. As part of the Microsoft software release process, all software released to the Download Center is scanned for malware before it is made available for public download. Additionally, after release, the software available from the Download Center is routinely scanned for malware. Microsoft recognizes that the threat environment is constantly changing and will continue to evolve over time, and we are committed to process improvements that will help protect our customers from malware threats How can I keep my software up to date? Microsoft offers a range of online services to help you keep your computer up to date. Windows Update finds updates that you might not even be aware of and provides you with the simplest way to install updates that help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience. Visit Windows Update to learn more. What can I find in the Microsoft Download Center, and how do I find what I’m looking for? The Microsoft Download Center has recently been revised to better serve you as a one-stop shop for products available for purchase, in addition to products and downloads available for free. For your convenience, items available for purchase are linked directly to Microsoft Store. Items available as free downloads are linked to details pages, where you can learn more about them and initiate downloads. If you would like Microsoft to scan your computer and recommend updates, please see the preceding question. If you would like to search for specific downloads, start by using one of these methods. To find products and downloads, in the navigation bar that appears across the center of the Download Center home page, click an icon. To search more specifically for a product or download, on the menu bar displayed near the top of the page, click a menu name and then click a product or download. To search by keyword, at the top of the page, in the Search Download Center search box, type the word or words you wish to search for. On the Search results page, you may see the following: An Editor's choice listing of products and downloads, which are recommendations based on the search term. A Sort by box on the right side of the page. Click the down arrow, and select a display order for the search results. A list of Filter options on the left side of the page. Click a Filter option to narrow the list of items displayed in the search results. The Filter option operates together with the original search term to narrow the scope of search results. When you see the item you’re interested in, click the item link to find out more about downloading or purchasing it. How do I find worldwide downloads? Microsoft delivers downloads in more than 118 languages worldwide. The Download Center now combines all English downloads into a single English Download Center. We no longer offer separate downloads for U.S. English, U.K. English, Australian English, or Canadian English. Select a Worldwide download from the English-language site On the download details page for a particular item, under Quick details, you will see a Change language box. Select the desired language from the drop-down list Note: The Change Language box appears only when a worldwide version of the download is available. If the box does not appear, the download has not yet been made available in languages other than English. If you see the box, but a specific language is not listed, the download is not yet available in that language. Which other Microsoft websites offer downloads? In this section, you will find links to other Microsoft websites that offer downloads. Note that almost all of the downloads available from these websites can also be found in the Microsoft Download Center; however, the other Microsoft sites may offer services and information that you may not find in the Download Center. If you are looking for downloads for the Windows operating system or for Microsoft Office, try using Windows Update , which helps you keep your computer up to date without requiring you to visit the Download Center. DirectX downloads Get the latest version of Microsoft DirectX, and find other important DirectX updates for your version of Windows. Service Packs for Microsoft Products Download service packs containing updates for system reliability, program compatibility, and security. See which service packs are currently available from Microsoft Help and Support. Windows Media Download Center Amplify your play with Microsoft Windows Media Player, encoders, codecs, and other related downloads. Azure downloads Get SDKs and tools for managing and interacting with Azure services Windows developer resources Get downloads and tools for Windows development Code samples Get started with Microsoft developer tools and technologies. Explore our samples and discover the things you can build. What should I do if I can’t find what I am looking for? If you cannot find a specific download, it may be available from a company other than Microsoft. Popular examples include Adobe Reader, Macromedia Shockwave and Flash players, and Java software. For current links to these downloads on their respective websites, use Bing to search the web for the download you are looking for. What information will I find on download pages? When you click a download item in the Download Center, you will be directed to the download details page for that download. Most of these pages follow a standard format and include most of the sections described here. Quick details The Quick details section contains helpful summary information, including the name and size of the download file and its date of publication. Change language In some cases, you'll see a Change language box, from which you can select a language other than English. Note that some downloads are not available in all languages. In addition, not all non-English downloads are accompanied by localized details pages. As a result, you may find English descriptions and instructions on pages for non-English downloads. Download button or link For each file listed, you will see a Download button or link in the Quick details section. Click this button or link to begin the download. Overview The Overview section includes a brief explanation of the issues addressed by the download and the benefits it provides.

Related resources These links take you to how-to information, newsgroups, special offers, and other resources pertinent to the download you have selected. What should I do if I cannot complete a download? If you cannot complete a download, you may need to clear the cache in your browser.  Here are Instructions for how to clear the cache in Microsoft Edge . How do I install downloaded software? Before you can use any software that you download, you must install it.

Note: When you save a download file, make sure to save it to a location that you will remember when you are ready to install the download. We suggest creating a special folder on your desktop to which you always save downloads. Follow these steps to create such a downloads folder: Right-click an unused area of your desktop.

Fumigation was started by the university in order to control the over-population of squirrels, but doing so put the kit foxes. These endangered species live on campus in harm’s way, according to Sarah Alame, the Director of Sustainability on ASI. Initially,  facilities claimed that kit foxes would not be in danger because the burrows that were being targeted were less than 4 inches in diameter, but this quickly proved false when biology students on campus provided photo evidence that kit foxes can actually fit through a 2-inch hole. Not only this, students for Sustainability, a club on campus that advocates for environmental safety and caution explained that facilities have not been responding to their concerns and do not attend committees meant to raise awareness about issues surrounding the topic at the university. Facilities are run by Joe Hedges, and currently, the Sierra Club is filing a formal complaint to the both the Federal and State Departments of Fish and Wildlife for what they describe as “threatful” behavior and actions against the San Joaquin Valley Kit Fox.  Not only kit foxes but there have been eyewitness reports of staff of facilities not utilizing the proper personal protective equipment when handling carbon monoxide, which is a lethal substance. Sarah Alame, Uriel Prado, and Alexandria Brown were some of the students that made their voices heard at this listening session, and all explained their surprise at being put under a 3 min time limit, but still were glad they got to have their voices heard. When talking to students for sustainability, they made their list of demands clear for the university. These being the number of people that have been injured due to burrows, how many have contracted diseases because of squirrels, how much money has gone to handle this overpopulation, and if there are contractions if they have the tests to prove this claim.

David Melendez, assistant professor of theatre history and literature, directed the play. “The Last Croissant” was presented in the same week and connected with the CSUB Sustainability Symposium , which brought awareness of sustainability of both the environment and personal life. The play sets the stage for self-analyses , such as what sustainability means. The setting was a campsite which had different campers and each visitor had their own approach to the challenges presented to them. Sustainability helps keep a healthy mindset and also allows people to face challenges with confidence. Tjioe purposefully had a woman play a character for the husband, Frederick, and a man play the wife, Imogen. She also had one character play the role for both , October and February , who are brother and sister. By doing so, the characters’ personas were center stage and their messages were appreciated. “Sustainability has everything to do with our relationships,” said Melendez. This means that people need to be mindful of how they treat one another based on how they communicate. Melendez adds, “we have to cherish the relationship that sustains us.” When people care for one another, our environment is cared for as well. For the married couple in the play, Fredrick and Imogen, learning how to be vulnerable was their challenge. Maia Garcia played Fredrick , who learned how to be more considerate towards his wife, Imogen, played by Matthew Penner. Garcia said, “I’m a woman playing a man, but I’m also playing a person.” This is important for Garcia and it really showed through their performance. Seeing the growth in their characters after they learned how to communicate was a positive experience. Imogen felt unheard, unseen , and unwanted. Being alone with nature helped her step away from her own feelings and have a different perspective of her situation. At first, she was uncomfortable being in a setting where there were no soft beds, spas or television. She was expecting to spend her anniversary at a luxury hotel , and instead , she was camping and roughing it out in the woods. Penner said, “what I’ve taken as Imogen is to be more confident.” Eventually, she allowed herself to swim in the lake. Swimming in the lake symbolically washed her from her previous notion of what her relationship was supposed to be. It gave her clarity in regards to her relationship which led her to be more sympathetic to her husband. Penner mentions how learning to be vulnerable takes a lot of confidence. “That’s ok to break down and be with your own emotions,” said Penner. This is an important message that can help with sustainability. “ The Last Croissant ” was a great a subsequent event to CSUB Sustainability Symposium. Bringing awareness of the importance of sustainability through gatherings and entertainment is both motivating and fun for the campus community.

Those who were honored wore a lavender stole in remembrance of LGBTQ+ history. The pink triangle that gay men were forced to wear in Nazi concentration camps and the black triangle that labeled lesbians as political prisoners in Nazi Germany were featured on their stoles. Dr. BreAnna Evans-Santiago was the keynote speaker of the evening, and she gave words of wisdom, encouragement and a lesson about the history of those who have advocated for LGBTQ+ students on the California State University, Bakersfield campus. “I have fought and advocated for identities with in an education setting. Because of our love and advocacy, we have saved student’s live,.” said Evans-Santiago during her emotional speech to the graduates. The graduates were also thankful to be graduating and to celebrate alongside those who are part of the community. “I am happy that CSUB can make everyone feel welcome. It makes me feel amazing that this can be a safe place,” said ally, Sarah O’Leary, a senior studio arts major with a minor in anthropology. Another student who graduated and earned their lavender stole during this evening was Brianna Santaella. “As a queer person on campus it is important to recognize the success between queer and trans people in our community. Support is important to their academic success as well. Being an ally is important for visibility, support and change,” said Santella. The ceremony was closed out by President Zelezny. She ended the ceremony by telling the graduates, “Remember how near or far your talents and education take you, you will always have a home at CSUB.” Gallery | 7 Photos Student's waiting for the  lavender ceremony to stat on May 11.

For 55 years, Disney was overseen in its own special tax and governing jurisdiction by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. According to their website, this district “is a local government entity, created in 1967 by a special act of the Florida Legislature, the purpose of which is to support and administer certain aspects of the economic development and tourism within District Boundaries.” This was acting as a county government, where landlords like Disney would foot the bill for the utilities like fire, power, water roads and other things of that nature. Local taxpayers would not pay anything to maintain them, and this district would gain its money by controlling how taxation and fees are levied in their district. Whoever controls this group would have massive sway over the groups and people inside the district, namely, Walt Disney World Resort. This year, Gov. DeSantis replaced several members of the group with hand-selected individuals. In an article by AP News, “The five supervisors were appointed by the Republican governor to the board after the Florida Legislature overhauled Disney’s government in retaliation for the entertainment giant publicly opposing the so-called ‘Don’t Say Gay’ legislation.” AP News also reported in that article that this move had helped the governor’s reputation as a culture warrior—something that could be useful for a potential presidential run in the future. What the governor did wasn’t so much to change anything about the relationship between Disney and Reedy Creek, but instead, merely put his own people on the inside. Although, he did want to change the name from Reedy Creek to Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. This would have granted power over Disney, or at least given him enough influence over them that they would have to consider him in most of their stances and decisions. However, Disney revealed on March 29, 2023, to have taken measures to prevent him from getting the power he wanted earlier that year. According to an article from CNBC, a change was made on Feb. 8, 2023: “As part of a 30-year development agreement, Disney no longer needs board approval to build high-density projects or buildings of any height and can sell and assign development rights.” This clause is mainly used in the UK, where the clause will continue to work 21 years after the death of the last descendant of King Charles III. According to the same CNBC article, if any of the current grandchildren live to 80 years of age, this Disney buffer will last for 100 years. Along with this, Disney banned the usage of its materials and characters from being used by the board and added protection to keep it from being overthrown.
