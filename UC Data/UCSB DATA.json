Fujino on her new book, Contemporary Asian American Activism: Building Movements for Liberation . From the publisher's summary: \"In the struggles for prison abolition, global anti-imperialism, immigrant rights, affordable housing, environmental justice, fair labor, and more, twenty-first-century Asian American activists are speaking out and standing up to systems of oppression. Creating emancipatory futures requires collective action and reciprocal relationships that are nurtured over time and forged through cross-racial solidarity and intergenerational connections, leading to a range of on-the-ground experiences. Bringing together grassroots organizers and scholar-activists, Contemporary Asian American Activism presents lived experiences of the fight for transformative justice and offers lessons to ensure the longevity and sustainability of organizing. In the face of imperialism, white supremacy, racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, ableism, and more, the contributors celebrate victories and assess failures, reflect on the trials of activist life, critically examine long-term movement building, and inspire continued mobilization for coming generations.\" Professor Fujino co-edited this new book with Robyn Magalit Rodriguez , professor and chair of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis. Department Spotlight Our department would like to give a special shout out to one of our majors, Felix Dong, for publishing his opinion piece This Can’t Keep Happening: Anti-Asian Incidents in the The Bottom Line (March 3, 2022), UCSB's student-run newspaper. In his article, Felix discusses how traumatic the rise in anti-Asian incidents have been on the Asian American community in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. He goes on to describe anti-Asian hate crimes in recent history, both in the US and on the UCSB campus. For these reasons, Felix argues, \"[w]e cannot keep hearing these names on the news, sending our prayers, and continuing this cycle.\" He encourages his readers to take action, from calling their representatives to volunteering with community organizations. Most importantly, he argues, we must \"spread awareness and talk about what is happening...We must talk about racism and address it, however uncomfortable it may be. These uncomfortable conversations mean addressing our own internal bias, vulnerabilities, and trauma but are also an opportunity for us to come together as a community.\" Thank you, Felix, for your illuminating article! We hope it drives more community members to have difficult conversations and take action against anti-Asian hate.

Professor Strongman establishes Transcorporeality as the distinct Afro-Diasporic cultural representation of the human psyche as multiple, removable and external to a body that functions as its receptacle. This unique view of the body, preserved in its most evident form in African religious traditions on both sides of the Atlantic, allows the regendering of the bodies of initiates who are mounted and ridden by deities of a gender different than their own during the ritual ecstasy of trance possession.

Official statement in support of #BlackLivesMatter here . Spanish version of official statement in support of #BlackLivesMatter here . Established in Fall 1970, the Chicana/o Studies Department emerged from Black and Chicana/o student activism, most notably the North Hall building take-over in Fall 1968 and the El Plan de Santa Barbara conference held at the Francisco Torres residential hall in April 1969. The UCSB Chicana/o Studies Department was the first such unit in the entire UC system.  Chicanx/Latinx student organizing, namely the 1989 and 1994 hunger strikes, strengthened the Department over time, leading to the creation of the world's first doctoral program in Chicana/o Studies which began in 2003.  The Chicana/o Studies Department engages students in the interdisciplinary study of Chicana and Chicano history, culture, and politics. The Department is fully committed to social justice and uprooting all systems of inequality.  In partnership with affiliated faculty from across campus and Feminist and Black Studies Ph.D. emphasis programs, the Department's B.A./M.A./Ph.D. programs challenge students to link theory with practice, scholarship with teaching, and the academy with the community.

Study focuses not only on East Asia’s increasingly vital role on the world scene, but also on various elements of the region’s long and fascinating history. Chair's Welcome Mayfair Yang, Department Chair The societies of East Asia today (China, Japan, and Korea), comprise an area of the world that is an economic powerhouse, a fountain of dynamic cultural and media creations, a producer of technological innovations, with a long and continuous recorded history going back to ancient times. The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies tries to do justice to this very important corner of the globe with a vibrant and diverse curriculum and world-class academic research. We offer the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degree programs in Chinese Studies, Japanese Studies, and Asian Studies, with plans to build up our Korean Studies program. Our Department faculty are rigorously trained in a variety of academic disciplines: literature and literary history, popular culture and media studies, drama and theater, social and art history, gender studies, religious history and religious studies of contemporary societies, environmental humanities, translation studies, anthropology, and sociology. We teach elementary, intermediate, and advanced Chinese, Japanese, and Korea language courses, as well as translation classes. We also offer content classes on medieval Daoism and Chinese and Japanese Buddhism, as well as the anthropology of religion in modern times. Classes on premodern Chinese and Japanese literature, calligraphy, and painting provide students with a good grasp of the cultural sophistication of these civilizations. Gender studies is covered by courses on women’s literature, masculinity, and gendered power relations in East Asian societies. We also have courses on modern Chinese and Japanese history, and contemporary Chinese, Japanese, and Korean literature and film. Courses on the anthropology of modern East Asian societies and East Asian environmental humanities immerse students in the modern transformation of East Asia. We look forward to welcoming some of you to our Department for a physical visit, once the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines have been deemed sufficient. Meanwhile, we welcome you to peruse our Department website digitally at a safe distance. Anti-racism Statement We, the faculty in EALCS, condemn the racism and violence against the Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) in this country and beyond. The settler colonial occupation of the United States entailed the removal of Indigenous tribes to clear the land for enslaved African and Black people, whose labor literally built the nation. Thus, our society is founded on the dispossession of Indigenous Americans, enslavement of Black Americans, and settler colonialism by European immigrants. Most recently, the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Chantel Moore, Breonna Taylor and too many others are not just tragic but deeply unjust. We recognize the persistent anti-blackness and racial inequity rooted in this centuries-old injustice...

Why the Way We Talk About Racial Justice Matters Edited by Felice Blake and Paula Ioanide, Alison Reed In The Virus Touch Bishnupriya Ghosh argues that media are central to understanding emergent relations between viruses, humans, and nonhuman life. Writing in the shadow of the HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 global pandemics, Ghosh theorizes “epidemic media” to show how epidemics are mediated in images, numbers, and movements through the processes of reading test results and tracking infection and mortality rates The Virus Touch Theorizing Epidemic Media Author: Bishnupriya Ghosh The Critics and the Prioress responds to a critical stalemate between the demands of ethics and the entailments of methodology. The book addresses key moments in criticism of the Prioress’s Tale —particularly those that stage an encounter between historicism and ethics—in order to interrogate these critical impasses while suggesting new modes for future encounters. It is an effort to identify, engage, and reframe some significant—and perennially repeated—arguments staked out in this criticism, such as the roles of gender, aesthetics, source studies, and the appropriate relationship between ethics and historicism. The Critics and the Prioress Antisemitism, Criticism, and Chaucer's Prioress's Tale Author: Heather Blurton The inscriptive . . . takes shape within the context of a heightened awareness of the intensified generation and circulation of language across media environments by human and nonhuman agents alike… Inscriptive Studies Toward a Field Articulation Edited by Rita Raley and Paul Benzon In Inventing William of Norwich Heather Blurton resituates Thomas’s account by offering the first full analysis of it as a specifically literary work. The second half of the twelfth century was a time of great literary innovation encompassing an efflorescence of saints’ lives and historiography, as well as the emergence of vernacular romance…She examines The Life and Miracles within the framework of these new textual developments and alongside innovations in liturgical and devotional practices to argue that the origin of the ritual murder accusation is imbricated as much in literary culture as it is in the realities of Christian-Jewish relations or the emergence of racially based discourses of antisemitism.

In 2018, Zippia (a career and recruiting website) named UCSB #5 in their top ten list of colleges in California for Romance languages and linguistics, based on mean career earnings for graduates, percentage of graduating class that were Romance language and linguistics majors, and university admissions and cost. More information can be found here . Our faculty, comprised of 7 professors, one senior lecturer and 3 lecturers in French, and 2 professors and 6 lecturers in Italian, is deeply committed to both research and teaching. Our faculty is recognized nationally and internationally, and we invite you to learn about their research by visiting their personal pages.  Our French program focuses on three major areas: French and Francophone literature and culture, ranging from medieval fiction, poetry and drama to contemporary literature, literary theory and intellectual history, French language and linguistics, including language pedagogy and second-language acquisition. In addition, we offer French courses designed to address professional interests, including business, biology and bioethics, law, international relations and globalization. Our Italian program is focued on the cultural history of the modern Italian nation seen from a global perspective. Besides the traditional Italian Studies major, with courses taught in both Italian and English focusing on both Italian high arts and mass culture, our program offers the first Transnational Italian Studies emphasis, taught entirely in English, and exploring the \"making of Italians\" from a postcolonial and global perspective. By contrast, the Italian minor is taught entirely in Italian and focuses on linguistic competency and translation. We provide our students with extensive training in French and Italian language and culture, literary history, theory and criticism. As a part of the College of Letters and Science , our faculty is dedicated to interdisciplinary work and has close affiliations with other departments and programs, such as Comparative Literature, Film Studies, Theater and Dance, Medieval Studies, Renaissance Studies, Religious Studies, Sociology, Global Studies and Feminist Studies. Our Department offers undergraduate programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts in French and in Italian Studies . We also support the Doctorate and the Master of Arts in Comparative Literature, through a new specialization called \"French in Comparative Literature.\" Doctoral students may also declare a special emphasis in Applied Linguistics, Medieval Studies, Translation Studies, and/or Feminist Studies. Our web pages will guide you to the requirements as well as to the goals and objectives of our various degrees. With the goal of a global education in mind, our Department strongly encourages study abroad in Italy or in a French-speaking country with any UC-approved program or with the many UC-affiliated programs in Paris, Bordeaux, Lyon, Bologna, Milan, Rome, and Florence. Click here to learn more about the Education Abroad Program in France and Italy . We invite you to navigate our website, which will give you a detailed picture of our Department as you learn more about our research, courses, undergraduate and graduate programs, and contact information. Jean Marie Schultz, Chair chair@frit.ucsb.edu Career Opportunities The Department of French and Italian, the Department of Germanic and Slavic Studies, and the Comparative Literature Program are seeking candidates to fill a position of Assistant Professor in translation studies and translation theory, with additional expertise or a degree in comparative literature or the digital humanities. Please note that the position is currently on hold due to the COVID pandemic.  Do please continue to consult this website for updated information. DEPARTMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS Departmental Statement on the Student Strike We, faculty members in the UCSB Department of French and Italian, stand with our university’s graduate students—and with graduate students, graduate researchers, and postdoctoral researchers across the University of California system—in their efforts to obtain a fair living wage. Graduate students play an essential role in the workings of the university and we need, value and appreciate the excellent work they perform. A fair wage is essential to drawing a robust, diverse group of graduate students that will ensure the future of our profession. We call on the University of California to make every effort to reach an acceptable agreement, increasing graduate student salaries in a manner that addresses the considerable economic burdens that our students face while living in one of the most expensive areas in the nation. By addressing the students’ legitimate demands, the university can avoid disruption to our core mission. We recognize that academic workers in UAW 2865, UAW 5810, and SRU-UAW have a legal right to participate in strike actions and we call on the University of California to refrain from any form of retaliation against legitimate strike activity. We urge the university to swiftly come to an agreement where everyone’s needs can be met. Cities Under Stress: Urban Discourses of Crisis, Resilience, Resistance, and Renewal Third International Conference of the Association for Literary Urban Cities (ALUS), 17-19 February, 2002 Keynote speakers: Caroline Levine (Cornell U) & Sarah Meerow (Arizona State U) Full program here Announcing the publication of Professor Renan Larue's La Pens ée v égane : Veganism is a growing movement that opposes animal suffering and promotes environmental sustainability. However, it is subject to a host of criticisms, mainly due to our culinary, medical, philosophical, and religious traditions. Discussions around veganism are animated but not always up to the challenge: disagreements between vegan advocates and opponents are often based on misconceptions and misunderstandings. This book fills in the gaps and adds to a debate that has become more crucial than ever. Announcing Professor Claudio Fogu's book The Fishing Net and the Spider Web Prof. Fogu's book explores the role of the Mediterranean in the 'making of' Italians. Reinterpreting key historical processes and actors in the history of modern Italy, the book challenges mainstream interpretations of Italian collective identity as weak or incomplete highlighting the importance of the Mediterranean Sea to the development of Italian collective imaginaries. Mediterranean imaginaries, Fogu argues, acted as counterweights to the solidification of a national form of identity by offering alternative but equally viable modes of collective belonging.

The philosopher Franz Rosenzweig once wrote that as many languages one speaks, as many times one is a human being. Our mission is to teach German and Slavic languages, and to research and teach the literatures and cultures of the peoples living in these languages. We offer classes that address the highly complex histories and cultures of German speaking and Slavic countries. While our classes are steeped in the histories of these different literatures and cultures, our faculty believes that studying the past has an impact on the present, and that studying the diversity of literatures helps our students understand the present in its complexity and with the many challenges of a globalized world. About a decade ago, the Report of the Presidential Humanities Commission of the University of California noted that the humanities “can help all members of the university community, but especially students, learn how to negotiate our culturally diverse contemporary world in ways that are both knowledgeable and sensitive.” It is such knowledge and such sensitivity that the acquisition of other languages and the study of their multi-faceted literatures develop and foster in depth; in ways that deeply impact the learner’s and researcher’s life.

When established in early 1999, it was widely recognized as one of the nation's first interdisciplinary undergraduate majors in international studies to focus on globalization. Today, the Program is now the Department of Global Studies and has a highly successful Masters Program in Global Studies, a PhD emphasis in Global Studies, and a growing PhD in Global Studies program. Global Studies is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding globalization as a multidimensional, multi-level and historical process. Global Studies bridges social science and humanistic approaches to analyze the social, cultural, political, environmental, and economic consequences of global flows, institutions, and processes. Global Studies scholarship is motivated by engagement with contemporary transnational social problems across multiple theoretical perspectives and methodologies. About the Department UCSB Global Studies Department statement on withholding grades The faculty of the Global Studies Department at the University of California Santa Barbara supports the 2022 UAW Strike of academic workers represented by UAW 2865, UAW 5810, and SRU-UAW. UC graduate workers, postdoctoral scholars, and academic researchers make our core missions of research and education possible. Systemic changes to address cost of living crises that affect student accessibility and opportunity within the UC system are long overdue. The Global Studies department faculty members express their support of these workers, and stand in solidarity with the strikers. We will not perform—or hire others to perform—work that would ordinarily be done by a striking graduate student, postdoc, or researcher. We pledge grade withholding and grade submission for the Fall 2022 quarter, in solidarity with faculty who cannot post grades without graduate labor. In addition, as we affirmed in our last statement , we will not engage in retaliation based on academic workers' participation or non-participation in strike activities in all matters under our direct control, and we will publicly oppose unlawful retaliation measures against either striking students or faculty respecting the picket line, should these be proposed by the University.

It is unacceptable that the University of California's current salary rates create conditions in which students spend well over 50% of their monthly salary for rent, live in their cars and rely on local food banks for themselves and their families. The HAA faculty greatly value our graduate students and the key role they play in teaching and creating knowledge, and we recognize them as essential participants in our university community and the mission of the public university.

Courses in Judaica and modern Hebrew have been offered since 1966, and an undergraduate Jewish Studies Minor, now housed in the Department of Religious Studies , was established in the fall of 1995. Courses in Biblical Hebrew and modern Hebrew language are offered, as well as Yiddish. The Department of Religious Studies includes faculty whose research and teaching within Jewish Studies range from Biblical Hebrew to the religions of the Ancient Near East to Rabbinic literature and Jewish mysticism to the sociology of contemporary Jerusalem. Twenty-five faculty in more than ten departments teach courses on literature, history, art, architecture, and film on such subjects as German Judaism, American Jewish novelists, the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Western and Eastern European countries, Jews in Israel and in the Diaspora, the politics of the Middle East, Jewish communities of medieval Spain, the architectural history of modern Jerusalem, and Holocaust Studies. For more than ten years, the Herman P. and Sophia Taubman Foundation Symposia in Jewish Studies at the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center has sponsored conferences, lectures, performances, residencies, and exhibits by eminent writers, critics, scholars, journalists, civic leaders, artists, actors, musicians, dancers, and filmmakers. This nationally-recognized public programming has brought the community to campus and developed important relationships between the campus and local Jewish organizations. Our faculty and students have collaborated with the Jewish Federation of Greater Santa Barbara on its Portraits of Survival exhibition, producing an award-winning video. UC Santa Barbara also has an active Hillel program, and faculty, students, and administrators work closely with Hillel and community members to advance common educational goals.

Announcements Welcome to Latin American and Iberian Studies Latin American and Iberian Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara examines the people and cultures of Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries throughout the world. Such study encompasses not only Spain, Portugal, and Latin America, but also Angola, Mozambique, the Philippines, Macao, and the Chicano and Puerto Rican populations in the U.S. However, most students center their studies on Latin America. Latin American and Iberian Studies examines the whole culture or civilization, not only throughout the humanities and fine arts, but also throughout the social sciences and history. This allows students to explore a variety of topics – in addition to Spanish and Portuguese language and literature – such as Latin American anthropology, the history of Spain and Portugal, and the political life of Latino communities.

Welcome to UCSB Linguistics The Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara stands at the forefront of several converging trends in the field of linguistics, thanks to a series of key decisions made when the department was founded in 1989. UCSB Linguistics was created to realize a vision of linguistics as a field that would seek explanations for language as a fundamental human activity, through an understanding of how languages are used by their speakers. From the beginning, the department committed itself to maintaining a sharp focus on the theoretical and methodological tools that would be needed to realize this vision, and to developing a broad empirical base for the work via a typologically diverse sampling of the world’s languages. As more and more researchers across all fields of linguistics are seeking well-motivated explanations and firmly grounded empirical evidence for claims about the nature of language, UCSB’s longstanding leadership in this enterprise puts the department at the cutting edge of linguistic scholarship, developing ideas and methods that are critical for moving the field of linguistics into a new era.

Wednesday, June 14th, 2023 at 3pm PDT, location TBD. GDJ: A Tempo Synchronized Granulator Abstract Music technology has opened up possibilities for highly sophisticated sound design and composition. Composers are able to build temporally dense and sonically eclectic phrases that are not feasible for humans to play in real time. How do we blend the world of offline, complex composition and performance? I look towards the paradigm of a DJ, where one becomes an expert at taking composed, static (typically grid-based) music and recontextualizing it in a live setting via chopping, filtering, remixing, etc. This idea can be taken a step further through deconstructing composed music via granulation. My contribution is the GDJ (Granular DJ); a granular synthesis tool with guard rails to keep sonic output on tempo, allowing for the liquid sound design associated with granulation while constraining it to a grid used in popular songwriting and dance music. The GDJ leverages the granular tool kit to completely transform source material, while also using systems of staying in time and key, as seen in DJ workflows, to keep the tool constrained enough for solo or multi-performer contexts. GDJ is written in Max/MSP and is currently being used in a live performance system with the author and friend. Equivalence: An analysis of artists’ roles collaborating with Image Generative AI from the perspective of Conceptual Art through an interactive installation design practice , a Masters presentation by Yixuan Li. Thursday, June 15, 2023, 10:30am - 12pm PDT, Experimental Visualization lab (Room 2611, Elings Hall) and via Zoom. Equivalence: An analysis of artists’ roles collaborating with Image Generative AI from the perspective of Conceptual Art through an interactive installation design practice . Throughout the past year, the public has witnessed a multitude of high-performance text-to-image Generative AI models pushing the boundaries of image synthesis. These advancements have reshaped the art domain and sparked a great debate surrounding the role of artists and the nature of creativity in artwork created with Image Generative AI.\r\n                                    This master's project aims to analyze artists' roles and their relationship with machines when creating artwork with Image Generative AI. Drawing inspiration from Rhodes' 4P model of creativity, an analytical framework of 5P+E (Purpose, People, Process, Product, Press, and Evaluation) has been developed to compare the art-creating processes of Conceptual Art and Image Generative AI. To exemplify this framework, a practical case study titled \"Equivalence\" has been conducted. Equivalence is a multi-screen interactive installation that converts users' speech input into continuously evolving paintings constructed with Natural Language Processing Algorithms and Stable Diffusion Model. Instead of just using users' text prompts, this installation analyzes the emotion, grammar structure, and word choice, converting this information into architectural structures to investigate the relationship between language and image. Through comprehensive analysis and the execution of the case study, this master's project aims to broaden the understanding of artists' roles and foster a deeper appreciation for the creative aspects inherent in artwork created with Image Generative AI. Developing Audio Plugins , a Masters presentation by Nathan Blair. Thursday, June 15, 2023, 2-4pm PDT via Zoom. Developing Audio Plugins Abstract Since the beginning of 2022 I have developed four audio plugins using the C++ framework JUCE. In doing so, I accumulated various strategies for enhancing the dependability and efficiency of my programs; for example, I learned to avoid memory allocation in the audio thread, refuse third party libraries, and refrain from invoking system calls. However, I also discovered specific circumstances where each of these principles was no longer desirable. Rather than relying on rules of thumb and general guidelines, I sought to develop a set of first principles for developing production-level audio software. I argue that many good audio programming practices can be derived from the following fact: audio plugins are multi-threaded programs subject to a firm real-time constraint. With this framing in mind, I present The Template Plugin: a starting point for new plugin projects that integrates the best practices and creative solutions I have implemented in my own work. I justify the design of The Template Plugin by discussing effective strategies for thread synchronization, optimization, program state management, user interfaces, and build systems within the context of multi-threaded and real-time applications. \"Knot\", Pablo Colapinto \"Artificial Nature, Time of Doubles\", Haru Ji and Graham Wakefield \"openPOT\", Jing Yan \"Extruding Circos\", Mohit Hingorani News Professor JoAnn Kuchera-Morin gave a talk titled \" The Multi-Modality of Complex Systems - Special-Temporal Exploration \", at ACM SIGGRAPH DAC SPARKS - The Art of Scientific Visualization: Perceiving the Imperceptible, on April 28, 2023. Abstract Complex systems in nature unfold over many spatial and temporal dimensions. Those systems easy for us to perceive as the world around us are limited by what we can see, hear, and interact with. But what about complex systems that we cannot perceive, those systems that exist at the atomic or sub-atomic? Can we bring these systems to human scale and view this data just as we do in viewing real-world phenomena? As a composer working with sound on many spatial temporal dimensions, shape and form comes to life through sound transformation. What seems to be visually imperceptible becomes real and visually perceptible in the composer’s mind. As media artists we can now take these transformational structures from the auditory to the visual and interactive domain through frequency transformation. Can we apply these transformations to complex imperceptible scientific models to see, hear, and interact with these systems bringing them to human scale? About the SPARKS session: Our understanding of the world is limited by the capacity of our senses to ingest information and also by our brain’s ability to interpret it. Through the use of technology, we know that the universe we live in is far more complex and rich with information than what can be perceived by humanity. From microscopic to cosmic, information that transcends our lived experiences is difficult to comprehend. Our ability to augment our senses with technology has resulted in an accumulation of vast amounts of data, often in a form that needs to be translated to be understood. This SPARKS session explores the conceptual and creative aspects of scientific visualization. https://dac.siggraph.org/the-art-of-scientific-visualization-perceiving-the-imperceptible . DAC SPARKS - The Art of Scientific Visualization: Perceiving the Imperceptible - April 28, 2023 . Xenos, a new virtual instrument plug-in that implements and extends the Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis (DSS) algorithm, has been released. Developed by MAT alumni Raphael Radna as part of his Masters degree, Xenos implements DSS with modifications and extensions that enhance its suitability for general composition. Released in March 2023, Xenos is a virtual instrument plug-in that implements and extends the Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis (DSS) algorithm invented by Iannis Xenakis and notably employed in the 1991 composition GENDY3. DSS produces a wave of variable periodicity through regular stochastic variation of its wave cycle, resulting in emergent pitch and timbral features. While high-level parametric control of the algorithm enables a variety of musical behaviors, composing with DSS is difficult because its parameters lack basis in perceptual qualities. Xenos thus implements DSS with modifications and extensions that enhance its suitability for general composition. Written in C++ using the JUCE framework, Xenos offers DSS in a convenient, efficient, and widely compatible polyphonic synthesizer that facilitates composition and performance through host-software features, including MIDI input and parameter automation. Xenos also introduces a pitch-quantization feature that tunes each period of the wave to the nearest frequency in an arbitrary scale. Custom scales can be loaded via the Scala tuning standard, enabling both xenharmonic composition at the mesostructural level and investigation of the timbral effects of microtonal pitch sets on the microsound timescale. A good review of Xenos can be found at Music Radar: www.musicradar.com/news/fantastic-free-synths-xenos . Xenos GitHub page: github.com/raphaelradna/xenos . There is also an introductory YouTube video: Raphael completed his Masters degree from Media Arts and Technology in the Fall of 2022, and is currently pursuing a PhD in Music Composition at UCSB.

Created by faculty in both the College of Engineering and the College of Letters and Science, MAT offers an unparalleled opportunity for working at the frontiers of art, science, and technology, where new art forms are born and new expressive media are invented. In MAT, we seek to define and to create the future of media art and media technology. Our research explores the limits of what is possible in technologically sophisticated art and media, both from an artistic and an engineering viewpoint. Combining art, science, engineering, and theory, MAT graduate studies provide students with a combination of critical and technical tools that prepare them for leadership roles in artistic, engineering, production/direction, educational, and research contexts. The program offers Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in Media Arts and Technology. MAT students may focus on an area of emphasis (multimedia engineering, electronic music and sound design, or visual and spatial arts), but all students should strive to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and work with other students and faculty in collaborative, multidisciplinary research projects and courses. Alumni Testimonials \"With a deep interest in exploring sound, not only creatively, but technically and scientifically, I began my studies at MAT at UCSB. It was here, through academic discipline and perseverance, alongside professors and  colleagues, that I was able to hone my skills and begin my successful career. Years later, I am leading development of game audio and augmented reality technology at Apple. The strong academic foundations that I gained in spatial audio, sound synthesis, and audio engine architecture have allowed me to achieve even greater success in my career. I will always be grateful to those who helped me take those first steps to success!\" David Thall Lead Audio Programmer Game and Augmented Reality Technology Apple \"As a UCSB MAT Master's student (2002-2004), I benefited greatly from the required and elective courses taught by professional leaders with broad perspectives, both technical and humanistic. This helped me to improve my research skills, and to refine my academic vision, which culminated in a PhD (2009) from UCSB Electrical and Computer Engineering specializing in Digital Signal Processing. Since that time I have been employed at several academic institutions around Europe, where my broad technical and humanistic perspective has been unique and advantageous.\" Bob L. Sturm, Associate Professor School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science Royal Institute of Technology KTH Stockholm, Sweden \"As one of the first graduates of the Media Arts and Technology PhD program, I have found the experiences provided by the MAT community invaluable to both my professional development and personal enjoyment of creating technology-based experiences, throughout life. I have been employed for more than 10 years now in the department of Architecture, Design and Media Technology at Aalborg University Copenhagen, where I teach both interaction design and real-time signal processing for audio and music performance. As Associate Professor, I guide students to create their own software and hardware tools, concepts, and practices for creating new sonic and embodied interactions, as well as running the Augmented Performance Lab. Together with my colleagues, I helped start the Sound and Music Computing masters program in 2014, and co-chaired the international New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference in 2017.\" Dan Overholt Associate Professor Aalborg Univeristy, Copenhagen Denmark \"MAT is a rare graduate program in that it operates more like an creative ecosystem -- your work as a researcher is significant and connects to others.  People care a lot about what you are doing, and invest thought into your own thinking.  Throughout my eight years of study, from 2007 to 2015, and as a postdoctoral student afterwards, this supportive environment provided the technological, financial, and intellectual resources necessary for me to take risks in my work.  As a result, I was able to dive deep into subjects I thought were off limits to my cognitive function, and achieve the great satisfaction of learning how to learn better.  It is a testament to the culture fostered there that an experimental filmmaker such as myself entering the program with very basic programming skills can now make regular contributions to mathematics journals, work as a real-time computer graphics programmer in the DTLA arts district, be asked to consult on science fiction television dramas, and innovate novel geometrical algorithms of use in architecture.  I think the MAT program at UCSB is a hidden gem -- you enter it with one direction in mind, and come out brilliantly refracted into a spectrum of possibilities.\" Pablo Colapinto Oblong Industries Inc & Independent Artist Los Angeles \"The education and mentorship I received as an MAT student gave me the skills to discuss my work critically and in the context of the rich history of media arts; and has been pivotal in having my work accepted in exhibitions around the world, including Dubai, Montreal, Tehran, Hong Kong, New York and cities throughout the US.  Further, my PhD in MAT was instrumental in securing my position as Curator of Interactive Media for MOXI, the Wolf Museum of Exploration and Innovation.  In that capacity, almost half of the artists I have curated into MOXI have been MAT alumni, MAT faculty, MAT students, and distinguished media artists who I met as part of my work in the MAT program. My collaborations with MAT students and alumni are ongoing, and I continue to be grateful for the education, mentorship and community of the UCSB MAT program.\" Marco Pinter Computational Artist Curator of Interactive Media, MOXI (The Wolf Museum of Exploration + Innovation) Director of Software Innovation, InTouch Health 3309 Phelps Hall Santa Barbara, California 93106-6065 Fax: (805) 893-2930 General inquiries: info (at) mat.ucsb.edu Academic information: academic-info (at) mat.ucsb.edu Media Arts and Technology.

Capps Center Giving Middle East Studies The Middle East Studies (MES) Program was established in 1994 following a three-year planning period. The Letters and Science Executive Committee approved the major in May 1995, and it was endorsed by CEPAP in October 1995. The purpose of MES is twofold: 1) to grant a BA in Middle East Studies; and 2) to help graduate students in the various disciplines to obtain appropriate language and area-studies training as part of their degree programs, and to provide needed graduate financial assistance. In addition, MES provides funding and helps to coordinate lectures, colloquia, and visiting scholars. With the exception of two lower-division core courses, courses for the BA are drawn from those already offered through various departments in the College of Letters and Science. Twenty faculty members in a diversity of departments — including history, music and political science — serve on the advisory committee. In 2000, a Center for Middle East Studies was established to administer a federally-funded National Resource Center grant secured by MES faculty for instructional, programmatic and research support. Many of the Programmatic aspects of MES are currently supported by this Center. The Middle East Studies Major is an interdisciplinary major leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree in which students explore the myriad peoples, societies, languages, and cultures of the Near East and the Islamic worlds. The program brings together two overlapping but quite distinct areas of study: first, the Near East in the Ancient, Islamic, and modern periods; second, the religious and cultural traditions of Islam, both within its original Near Eastern homeland, and in other regions of the world where Islamic traditions have come to play a major role — South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and, (more recently) Europe and North America. As a key part of their studies Middle East Studies strongly recommends, though does not require, that students spend a substantial period of time abroad in the UC Education Abroad Program centers in Jerusalem or Cairo, or in other suitable programs. Members of the Advisory Committee will work actively with interested students to help them identify appropriate opportunities for study abroad. The program does not offer the M.A. or Ph.D. However, it can help graduate students to coordinate interdisciplinary study across departmental lines, and it also provides an enrichment of UCSB’s own resources through the lectures, colloquia, and seminars which it sponsors. Likewise, Middle East Studies can offer limited financial assistance, on a competitive basis, to qualified graduate students. Finally, the program also collaborates with the Von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies at UC Los Angeles in areas of common concern.

Capps Center Giving Message from the Chair Fabio Rambelli Professor and Religious Studies Department Chair Welcome to the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, one of the finest centers for the study of religious traditions and phenomena in the US and internationally. Since its founding in 1964, UCSB’s department has been at the forefront of discussions about the nature of religion and pioneered new theoretical and methodological approaches. Our department has engaged head-on the difficult question of what counts as “religion” and continues to demonstrate that understanding it is vital for our students and the world. We have stood behind the idea that the scholarly investigation of that which we call “religion” — and what is taken to be its opposite, the “secular” — must take place in a university setting where all ideas are subject to the same standards of inquiry. Our present and past faculty includes presidents of the American Academy of Religion, Guggenheim Scholars, and award-winning scholars. Today we are the largest Department of Religious Studies in the entire University of California system, and one of the largest Departments in the US solely dedicated to the secular study of religion. Our 24 full-time ladder faculty and 7 full-time lecturers, together with numerous affiliated faculty from other departments across the humanities and the social sciences, represent an unparalleled depth of expertise in studying the multifarious ways in which humans have conceptualized, interacted with, and contested the sacred. We offer a Major in Religious Studies, a Major in Middle Eastern Studies, and minors in Religious Studies, American Indian and Indigenous Studies, Iranian Studies, and Jewish Studies. The Department also teaches several critical languages (including Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Hindi, Turkish, Coptic, Kazakh, Sanskrit, and Tibetan), which are essential for an in-depth understanding of religions in their cultural contexts. (Other critical languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, as well as European languages including Greek and Latin, are offered by other departments.) We are very proud of the students we have educated over the years, who have learned to think, write, and speak about religions—about rituals, traditions, texts, and experiences—in deeply informed and critical ways. Our offerings are an indispensable part of a general liberal education. Students who graduated with us are active in academia and in the professions. Our Graduate Program in Religious Studies is among the very best in the country. Many of our alumni are faculty members at academic institutions in the US and abroad. Over the last several decades, the forces of globalization have dramatically changed the religious landscapes of our state, the nation, and the world. The academic study of religion has never been more important, and what we do together as specialists in our various fields has never been more relevant. We are exceptionally fortunate in having a gifted faculty, student body, and staff. I invite you to roam this website to see what we are all about and to understand why the study of religions at UCSB is so intellectually rewarding.

Black lives matter. We commonly hear that “The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.” This sentiment echoes in the national response to the current health crisis, where thousands and thousands have died and continue to die daily. Our expertise lies in the academic study of the world’s religions. Each emphasizes the sanctity of life.  In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, human life is holy because God is holy (Lev 19:4; Qur’an 5:32, 6:131; 1 Corinthians 3:16). In the Buddhist tradition, the first and foremost precept is the prohibition against taking life (any life, not only human); at the same time, the human condition is unique and precious because Buddhas can only appear in human form. In religious traditions of the African Diaspora, Black gods and ancestors rise up to defend Black and Latinx lives in historical rebellions and revolutions. The most well-known of these is the Haitian Revolution that began with the invocation Vodou deities in 1791 at Bwa Kayiman. Racially motivated killings are often processed as a statistic, notwithstanding the well-known killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and Ahmaud Arbery, among many others. In the violent taking of George Floyd’s life, witnessed by the world, we have not a statistic but a tragedy. It is both a reminder of the anti-Blackness embedded in our society and an example of the systemic institutional brutality directed towards minoritized communities. Read more...

The boundaries of the Renaissance are difficult to fix, and modern scholarship hesitates to construct a sharp boundary from the late-medieval world, but from some time in the late fifteenth-century to the mid-seventeenth century Europe saw mind-altering changes in the ways people understood their world. The names associated with the Renaissance alone proclaim the significance of the period: Shakespeare, Cervantes, Ariosto, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer, Bruegel, Caravaggio, Luther, Erasmus, Loyola, the Medici, Francis I, Elizabeth I, Columbus, Magellan, Drake. It was also the age of discovery, and the European encounter with the “New World” would change decisively, for better or worse, the face of four continents. Students can do course work in the appropriate courses in English, the European literatures, history, art, art history, and music. They can construct a major that emphasizes some particular field of endeavor (for example, literature, art, history, music) or they can choose an eclectic mix of courses in the period. Renaissance Studies can also be paired with a departmental major to create a double major that combines intense study of the period with a more traditional focus; eight units may count to ward credit in both majors. With the assistance of members of the advisory committee and in consultation with the chair of the program, students will set up individual programs of study from the beginning of their junior year. Students are also encouraged to consider spending a year of their undergraduate study in a European university through the Education Abroad Program.

Reginald Daniel With great sadness, we announce the passing of Reg Daniel. He was a friend, colleague, mentor, educator, and inspiration to so many people who have been part of the Sociology Department and the UCSB campus over the decades. As a pioneer in the field of Critical Mixed Race Studies, his work influenced generations of scholars and activists. This is a tremendous loss. We offer our condolences to all who are mourning. If you wish to share your thoughts and memories of Reg, you can do so on this memory board . We established a G. Reginald Daniel Memorial Fund which will be devoted to honor his legacy as a teacher, mentor, and pioneering scholar of Critical Mixed Race Studies. He had a profound impact on generations of students as well as scholars and activists within and beyond the university. The funds will support graduate and undergraduate students in the Department of Sociology as well as the ongoing work on Critical Mixed Race Studies. Message from the Chair Welcome to the UCSB Sociology Department. Established in 1944, our highly ranked department is among the most diverse nationwide in terms of faculty and students. Our faculty include internationally renowned scholars whose research and teaching have influenced intellectual developments affecting the landscape of the discipline, including intersectional analysis of social phenomena, new approaches to the study of gender and sexualities, social movements as drivers of social and political change, the “cultural turn” in Sociology, and a “reflexive turn” in ethnography. In 2022, the US News and World Report Guide to Graduate Departments ranked USCB Sociology third nationwide in the subfield of Sex and Gender, and tenth in Sociology of Culture. Our core areas of long-standing strength are Gender and Sexualities; Culture; Race, Ethnicity, and Nation; and Global Sociology. We also have specializations in Demography; Environmental Sociology; Health and Medicine; Immigration; Justice, Law and Human Rights; Social Interaction and Conversation Analysis; and Social Movements. Many of our faculty play leadership roles in the discipline, and many faculty, students, and alumni model interdisciplinarity, social justice, and public-facing scholarship through their work. Our undergraduate program is large and vibrant and the department now graduates more Sociology majors than any other university in the country. Some of our students go on to graduate programs in Sociology and other academic disciplines, and others pursue careers law, education, social work, health care, public policy, and civil society organizations to name a few. Our graduate students are trained and mentored to undertake ambitious dissertation projects on a wide variety of topics. To nurture intellectual dialogue and specialized expertise, department faculty and grad students convene workshops on topics of shared interest that provide exposure and engagement with cutting-edge developments in scholarship. Many graduates obtain tenure-track teaching positions in universities and colleges, and others build careers in the public sector, community-based networks, and philanthropic and research institutions. You are invited to explore this web page to learn more about our department, including the specializations and achievements of our faculty, and details about the academic program and other learning opportunities available to our students.

Students take courses in CCS and across campus, including the Department of Art, the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, and the graduate program in Media Arts and Technology. Each student works with a faculty advisor who oversees an individual course of study to support the creation of original work. The students develop a mature body of work during residency with several exhibition opportunities, culminating in a solo show in her senior year. Some students receive funding from CCS to support their research or creative activities through the Traveling Undergraduate Research Fund. Emphases Painting The Painting Emphasis is for highly motivated students who can work independently and who want to understand the past and create the future of drawing and painting. CCS Art student Cassondra Cunningham in her studio. Credit: Will Proctor Sculpture / Spatial Art The Spatial Arts Emphasis guides focused students in the creation of art that relates to our spatial awareness within the material world. The expanded field of art in this emphasis includes sculpture, drawing, installation and site-specific works, performance, media projection and sound, and public art in the form of individual or collaborative projects. Students learn to derive content through the media they choose to work with and the associations emanating from each three-dimensional work. Book Arts The Book Arts Emphasis offers an exploration of text based art where students learn how to sharpen their understanding of typography, books, and print technologies. Students learn how to create hand-bound artists’ books in limited editions, devise ways to alter books into sculptural forms, or explore the various ways text is integrated into contemporary 2D and 3D art works. Students explore such strategies as narrative and sequence in art, the tradition of creating art forms in multiple editions, or develop conceptual ways to extend the book and text into space in installation works. Media and techniques may include, but are not limited to, relief printing, letterpress printing, book binding, papermaking, painting, drawing, photography, digital media, 3-D media. Curriculum Students are expected to work independently at a high level and are subject to a formal mid-career review as well as quarterly discussions to ensure that they remain on track. CCS Art Majors are expected to average 18 units of studio coursework per year. A studio course is one in which the student is making art. CCS Art Majors are required to average 9 units of non-studio, art-related courses per year. This includes but is not limited to classes in Art History, Theory, and Criticism. A non-studio, art-related course is one in which you learn about art but respond with written assignments or results other than art work. All CCS Art Majors must complete an internship. The goal is to give students experience in the professional art world or in research related to the student’s interests. In the past, students have fulfilled this requirement by: working for an art institution, working for a designer, architect, photographer, or conducting research under the supervision of an instructor, graduate student, or a professional in the field.

From the first year, students may pursue independent research under the guidance of an individual faculty advisor in areas such as marine biology, ecology, molecular biology biopsychology, paleontology, biological anthropology and microbiology. By doing research as an integral part of their college education, the faculty consider CCS Biology students as junior colleagues. By uniting the flexibility of the CCS Biology Major with the resources of a research-intensive university, students have the opportunity to develop as Biologists. Some students receive funding from CCS to support their research or creative activities through the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship and/or the Traveling Undergraduate Research Fund. Curriculum CCS biology classes are typically small seminar-style classes that are largely discussion based. Although each student's curriculum is flexible, CCS biology students normally take many of the same courses as biology majors in the College of Letters and Science (L&S). The distinction is that they take more upper division science courses, and take them earlier in their career, than majors in Letters and Science Biology.

By integrating these three areas of exploration, students will receive a well-rounded education in writing. Work in Creative Writing will help students develop their voice and gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in today’s publishing environment. The close reading and criticism performed through Literary Study will help students better understand and analyze literature. Experience in Writing Studies invites students to consider the composition, circulation, and purpose of writing in professional, academic, civic, and digital contexts. This interdisciplinary approach to writing will prepare students for a fulfilling writing life as well as a variety of careers, including professional writing, publishing, marketing, or graduate-level study. Some students receive funding from CCS to support their research or creative activities through the Traveling Undergraduate Research Fund. Curriculum The purpose of the Writing & Writing and Literature curriculum is to provide students with the grounding and guidance that will allow them to successfully pursue their independent scholarly and creative endeavors. Freshman and Sophomore colloquia in the three areas of study provide exposure to the forms of inquiry within these related fields and to the cutting edge research of UCSB faculty in these disciplines. Most upper division courses are taken in various College of Letters and Science Departments, such as Comparative Literature, English, Writing, the languages, and ethnic studies. The latter half of a student’s undergraduate career focuses on pursuing an independent project in research and/or creative writing, which culminates in the Senior Portfolio.

CALTEACH PREPARES EXCEPTIONAL K-12 TEACHERS IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS CalTeach is a University of California system-wide program to recruit, prepare, and support exceptional K-12 teachers in science and mathematics. The initiative began in response to both state and national concerns about the critical shortage of highly qualified elementary and secondary teachers. CalTeach at UCSB includes opportunities for both undergraduate students and graduate teacher credential candidates. These opportunities are outlined below. At the undergraduate level , CalTeach combines quality courses and classroom experiences to prepare students to enter a teacher education program, such as the UCSB Gevirtz School’s Teacher Education Program. Many students taking CalTeach courses opt to fulfill the Science and Mathematics Education Minor , which has two tracks. One track is for prospective elementary teachers and the second is for prospective secondary teacher. At the graduate teacher education level , those who have taken CalTeach courses and/or participated in the CalTeach Physical Sciences and Engineering or COASTAL programs as undergraduates are given preference for the NSF Noyce Teacher Scholar awards. For 2022-2023, the Noyce CalTeach COASTAL award is available for students seeking a secondary credential in biology, chemistry, physics, or mathematics in the UCSB Teacher Education Program . A Noyce Scholar award requires recipients to commit to two years of teaching in a high-needs school. Noyce Teacher Scholars also participate in regular enrichment activities and join a community of Noyce Teacher Scholars in California and the nation. One cannot receive both a Noyce and a TEACH award. For additional financial support for secondary science and mathematics teachers, see the Financial Support link on the left.

This comprehensive resource will serve as a helpful roadmap as you explore the broad array of courses, programs, activities, and services available on our campus. I encourage you to refer to it often. We have a tradition here at UC Santa Barbara of emphasizing both our undergraduate and graduate programs, and a balance of academic and extracurricular campus life. We work collaboratively to foster a supportive and inclusive environment in which students, staff, and faculty from richly diverse backgrounds and perspectives can explore and learn together. This is an extraordinary place. We are one of only 65 institutions elected to the prestigious Association of American Universities, and the first AAU member to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Newsweek has named UC Santa Barbara the \"Best Hispanic-Serving Institution\" in the nation. We are ranked No. 5 among the top public universities in the country; No. 9 worldwide for producing Nobel laureates in this century; and No. 2 among the nation’s top colleges most committed to economic diversity. These accolades highlight our strong commitment to academic excellence, diversity, and inclusion, as well as accessibility and affordability. We are proud of our campus, and we are proud of you! You are a valued member of our community of scholars and our UC Santa Barbara family. As you continue on your journey of intellectual discovery, we are here to support and encourage you every step of the way. Sincerely, Henry T. Yang Chancellor _____________________________________ Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information in the online General Catalog.

Our magnificent actual environment aside, our educational environment is a thing of beauty itself. Consider our distinguished and pioneering faculty, who are as committed to mentorship and teaching as they are to research. In fact, they’re known to do all three things in concert, and undergraduates play a key role. Hear for yourself how our faculty engages with students, expands their academic horizons and helps bring out their best in this ongoing series of videos, featuring professors from diverse disciplines talking about what makes our campus so rigorous and rewarding — for scholars and students alike. Philip Lubin The head of UC Santa Barbara’s Experimental Cosmology Group, Philip Lubin teaches his astrophysics students to reach for the stars. Covering topics from interstellar missions to planetary defense to lunar rovers, his lab teaches the practical and technical aspects of navigating and observing space, while encouraging collaboration and innovation, with results that provide benefits to students' future endeavors. Russell Schmitt and Sally Holbrook The professors of ecology, evolution, and marine biology have spent countless summers guiding undergraduate researchers through hands-on field work at the University of California’s Gump Research Station. Situated on the island of Moorea in the South Pacific, this collaborative and interdisciplinary setting allows students to gain field and laboratory experience, practice the research process, work alongside career scientists, and ultimately explore life in academia. Victor Rios Victor Rios never thought he would attend — much less graduate from — college. He did both, and went on to become an educator himself. Now a professor of sociology and associate dean of social sciences, Rios knows firsthand the powerful difference mentorship can make in a student’s life. Personally and professionally invested in finding solutions to educational inequality, he now works closely with undergraduates to both enrich their academic careers and give back to those who helped him succeed. John Park The professor of Asian American Studies, who specializes in immigration issues and law, says that at UC Santa Barbara, undergraduate students are essential to interdisciplinary research — and that motivated students have myriad opportunities to contribute. What the young scholars glean working alongside top faculty is invaluable, affording them crucial experience in field work, archival research and more as they look ahead to graduate or professional schools or prospective careers. Emily Jacobs A neuroscientist and assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences on her own journey to UC Santa Barbara, by way of Harvard, discusses opportunities in her lab available to students, and why she encourages undergraduates to explore every discipline they can. Phil Gans The professor of earth science, an expert in structural geology and tectonics, discusses the wide-ranging benefits to students of doing field work — from hands-on research experience to practical job skills such as teamwork and communication.

These esteemed scholars and scientists are conducting their research not only on campus, but all over the world. The award-winning video series \"Research in 60 Seconds\" highlights some of their pioneering advances and brilliant discoveries, in just about a minute. Watch the short yet engaging and informative segments housed here to learn more about the fascinating work coming out of UC Santa Barbara. A Plastic Recycling Breakthrough Probably the greatest barrier to recycling plastics is that the quality of the end product is far inferior to the quality of the original product, which disincentivizes would-be recyclers from investing time and resources into the process. But what if there was a way to create high-quality plastic from the original material? UC Santa Barbara chemical engineer Susannah Scott outlines a game-changing method of “upcycling” plastics, creating high-quality plastic molecules that would increase the appeal of recycling, allow us to repurpose existing plastic, and bring us closer to a circular economy. The World's Highest Jumping Robot UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering professor Elliot Hawkes and his team examine potential for jumping as a way for machines to navigate and survey their environments. Using animals as an — ahem — jumping-off point, they optimize the mechanics of jumping for machines, in the process creating a jumper that achieves the tallest known height of any known jumper, machine or biological. Measuring Bloch Waves Electrons behave differently in materials than they do in free space, and understanding how is critical for scientists studying material properties and engineers looking to develop new technologies. Researchers in Professor Mark Sherwin’s lab are using UC Santa Barbara’s free-electron laser to experimentally reconstruct these wavefunctions for the first time. Climate Change and Energy Politics UC Santa Barbara associate professor of political science Leah Stokes works at the intersection of climate change and energy politics. Her research takes a deep look at the climate crisis and its solutions - aiming to inform both the public and politicians who make decisions that affect the health of people and our planet. Developing a Soft Robot That Grows Forget those outdated ideas of robots as stiff, metallic machines — there's a new class emerging, and Elliot Hawkes is at the forefront. An assistant professor of mechanical engineering, Hawkes and his colleagues are developing a soft robot that does what many other robots can’t: squeeze into small spaces, navigate tight angles and exert pressure on objects without damage. The applications are myriad, from construction and underground exploration to search and rescue operations and even medical uses in the human body. [This video includes additional video footage courtesy Kurt Hickman/Stanford University] Understanding Factors in Coral Bleaching Coral reefs play an important role in maintaining a diverse marine ecosystem. They are also critical to the climate of the planet because they help regulate ocean temperature and circulation. And some coral reefs are more in danger than others. Professor Deron Burkepile of the Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology Department shares how his research lab is trying to understand the human impact on coral bleaching — and, in turn, ocean temperature. Turning Agricultural Waste into Energy Could the study of grass-eating animals lead to the discovery of new sustainable fuels and chemicals? It’s not as far-fetched as you might think. Cows and other large herbivores, which evolved to graze on grasses and other woody forage, have the ability to “unlock” the energy contained in plant cellulose and convert it to sugar. An associate professor of chemical engineering, Michelle O’Malley works to understand and cultivate the microbes that these animals have in their digestive system to use similar processes to create fuels and chemicals from agricultural waste rather than fossil fuels. Building Engagement to Create Social Change Hahrie Han’s work explores the best methods for engaging people in the democratic process. Previously the Anton Vonk Professor of Political Science and Environmental Politics at UC Santa Barbara, she explains how by focusing on relationships, organizations can foster deeper involvement to build power for change. Protecting Reef Sharks Sharks shape ocean ecosystems, and overfishing has caused their numbers to crash in a lot of places around the world. So how well do ocean parks protect sharks? From tracking shark traffic around one island in the Pacific, ecologist Douglas McCauley and his team discovered that sharks wander much further into the open ocean than anyone previously thought — a key finding for the development of future marine parks.

Get a glimpse into how we began, and how we’ve grown, in this timeline of key moments in our university’s history. Through the Years A Timeline of UC Santa Barbara The Pre-UC Days Continuing its evolution from an 1890s-born manual training school, the renamed Santa Barbara State Teachers College begins to grow its curriculum toward liberal arts education and to award four-year degrees. 1921 Olé! Allegedly inspired by Douglas Fairbanks’s performance in the 1927 film \"The Gaucho,\" the Gaucho is adopted as the school’s mascot. 1936 Entering the UC With broader curricula, the UC comes calling and brings another new name: The Santa Barbara College of the University of California. 1944 New Digs The college relocates from its longtime Riviera Campus in downtown Santa Barbara to Goleta, taking up residence on a site previously used as a World War II Marine Air Station base. The campus remains on the same spot today. 1954 Let There Be Light The Regents make it official and designate the college a general campus of the University of California system. Hello, UC Santa Barbara! 1958 Academic Expansion The College of Letters & Science is established, along with a School of Engineering and a School of Education . 1961 Worldwide Ambassadors The Education Abroad Program is launched at UC Santa Barbara, which is charged with administering the UC systemwide international study initiative. 1962 A Star is Born The College of Creative Studies , one of a handful of so-called “experimental colleges” to emerge on campuses nationwide in the 1960s, opens for business. 1967 Raising a Landmark Campus leaders dedicate Storke Tower, a 175-foot campanile with 61 bells, the tallest steel/cement structure in Santa Barbara County. It is affectionately named for Thomas Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and U.S. senator who was integral to the institution’s founding. 1969 Dawn of the Internet UCSB is one of the first four nodes of ARPANET, a network of computers with UCLA, Stanford and University of Utah. A project of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, the network relied on the transmission of “packets” of information. The number of nodes grew over the next decade, connecting computers across the country with the technology that would become the internet. 1969 Thoreau In the House Thoreau scholar Elizabeth Witherell relocates from Princeton to UCSB, bringing with her “ The Writings of Henry David Thoreau ,” a long-range scholarly endeavor to publish the contents of all 47 manuscript volumes of Thoreau's handwritten journals, his writings for publication and other uncollected papers. 1983 Microscopy Takes Off The atomic force microscope (AFM), which allows researchers to track biological processes in real time in invented in a UCSB physics lab. AFM enables researchers to actually see, at both spatial (down to the atomic scale) and time resolutions, how disease develops, and how the healthy body functions. 1986 Rising Through the Ranks UC Santa Barbara is elected a member of the Association of American Universities , a prestigious collective of 62 leading, research-intensive higher education institutions in the U.S. and Canada. 1995 Inaugural Nobel Physicist Walter Kohn, founder director of the campus’s Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, becomes the first UCSB faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize. He wins in chemistry, for his development of the density-functional theory. 1998 Presidential Preservation The American Presidency Project , a vast archive of documents related to the Presidency and used for its study, is established at UCSB. 1999 Two Times the Glory Two UCSB professors win Nobel Prizes: Alan Heeger (chemistry) for his role in the revolutionary discovery that plastics can have the properties of metals and semiconductors, and Herbert Kroemer (physics) for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed and opto-electronics. 2000 Victorious Once More UCSB again sees two of its professors achieve Nobel status: David Gross wins the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction; and Finn Kydland, for his contributions to dynamic macroeconomics, receives the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. 2004 The Birth of Sound The university launches the UCSB Cylinder Audio Archive , a searchable database of 10,000+ cylinder recordings — among the first commercially produced sound recordings — held and digitized by the UCSB Library. 2005 This is Soccer Heaven The Gauchos win the NCAA Men’s Soccer title. 2006 Hello Again, Alfred Professor Shuji Nakamura wins the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which has enabled bright and energy-saving light sources. He becomes the sixth UCSB faculty member to win a Nobel. 2014 A Commitment to Diversity UCSB is named a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities, so recognized for achieving Hispanic enrollment 25 percent or more of its total enrollment. The campus is the first HSI that also is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities. The same year, the campus also is designated an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI) by the U.S. Department of Education. 2015 Historical photos provided courtesy of University Archives Photographs Collection, Special Research Collections , UC Santa Barbara Library.

Arts May 23, 2023 A biblical villain goes on trial in the darkly comic “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot” Tom Jacobs What does purgatory look like? The artistic team for UC Santa Barbara’s new production of “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot” has spent a lot of time pondering that question over the past year or so. Stephen Adly Guirgis’s 2005 play is essentially an extended debate over whether the man who betrayed Jesus — and, by extension, others who have done terrible things — is deserving of forgiveness. It is set in a makeshift courtroom in purgatory, a site apparently chosen so that witnesses from both Heaven and Hell can testify. So what does this peculiar corner of the afterlife, one that is neither clouds and harps nor fire and brimstone, resemble? In this staging, which opens Thursday, May 25 in the Performing Arts Theater on campus, the answer resembles a long-forgotten, sadly forsaken indoor swimming pool. “When I came across images of an abandoned public pool, it felt like the right environment,” said set designer Ann Sheffield, a professor in the Department of Theater and Dance. “ We all latched onto that. It’s a space that was once useful and even joyous, but now is bleak — which makes it a reflection of Judas’ psyche. “His mind has shut down, and the space has with him. He has given up all hope, so he’s in a space that seems to have given up all hope.” “I wanted a post-apocalyptic setting,” explained director Kendra Ware. “That speaks a little bit to my view of our judicial system, which you can argue is crumbling.” “We went around and around on how much debris and litter should be there,” added Sheffield. “There will be random things. There will be a grocery-store shopping cart, as well as a tricycle — odd things that shouldn’t be there. There’s going to be a little stagnant water in the bottom of the pool.” The costumes will similarly reflect the fact that the judge and attorneys are residents of purgatory. “Some outfits are a hodgepodge they had to piece together,” Ware said. “For example, a female lawyer is wearing a man’s suit that has been repurposed for her. Another character wears a jacket which is made entirely out of oven mittens. “Among the witnesses, some live in Heaven, some in Hell,” she explained. “That influences their dress. One character comes down from Heaven wearing golf gear. We’re having a lot of fun with it.” For all its dark humor, however, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot” deals with serious themes of guilt and forgiveness — including self-forgiveness — and how long a person deserves to be shunned for a committing a bad action. For all its dark humor, however, “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot” deals with serious themes of guilt and forgiveness — including self-forgiveness — and how long a person deserves to be shunned for a committing a bad action. It’s clearly a personal play: The playwright, who won the Pulitzer Prize for the 2015 play “Between Riverside and Crazy,” is the product of an Irish mother and an Egyptian father — and as Ware notes, those are the ethnicities of the prosecutor and defense attorney. Ware, who once performed in a production of “Between Riverside and Crazy” in a former convent in Italy, describes Guirgis’ use of language as quite distinctive. “In this play, he mixes the reverent and the irreverent in a beautiful way,” she said. “A lot of profanity is used to punctuate a point. “He grew up in New York City, a place where people come from all over the world and speak many languages. It’s an amazing gumbo of styles and cultures,” Ware continued. “He captures that in his language. Saint Monica, for example, sounds like a young girl from the Bronx, or East L.A. His language is very much reflective of the community he was raised in. He uses it to uplift his characters and give them dignity.” Judas, in contrast, spends most of the play sitting in stunned silence. “We’re using a thrust configuration, so the audience is on three sides,” Sheffield said. In a sense, the audience members are the jury, and Judas can’t escape their judgment, no matter where he turns. This is the first UC Santa Barbara production for the Los Angeles-based Ware, who was approached by members of the theater faculty about directing this play. Originally from the East Coast, she earned a BFA from Sarah Lawrence College and an MFA from Cal Arts in Valencia. “When I left Sarah Lawrence, I was an actress,” she said. “By the time I got my master’s at Cal Arts, I was more of a multidisciplinary artist. It was there I started directing and creating original pieces, while also acting in shows.” Ware just completed a stint as the 2022 Lloyd Richards New Futures Resident Artist at Actors Theatre of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. While she is new to UC Santa Barbara, she has previous experience in the city: In 2013, she performed excerpts from her autobiographical, one-woman piece “Notes from the Underground” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Paseo Nuevo. As a multidisciplinary artist, she remains entranced by the theater. “Especially since COVID, it has really hit home that being in community with one another is very important,” she said. “There’s something about gathering together around the fire and sharing stories.” Or in this case, the abandoned pool. …………………. The Last Days of Judas Iscariot will be performed at 7:30 p.m. May 25, 26, 30, 31, and June 1 and 3, and at 2 p.m. May 27 and June 3 and 4, in the Performing Arts Theatre on campus.

It’s been a remarkably successful endeavor that has grown into a showcase program for the Division of Social Sciences, for the campus and for higher education excellence across the nation. The Pahls have just upped the ante. Building on their vision, and on their longtime generosity to the campus, the Pahls have made a $10.5 million gift to UC Santa Barbara to create the Pahl Center for the Study of Critical Social Issues in the Social Sciences. It includes an irrevocable $10 million gift through their estate and $500,000 in start-up funding for the next five years. “By creating the Pahl Center, we can add novel generative components, raising the work to new heights and establishing a detailed framework to achieve ambitious goals set out by the Pahl Initiative,” said Louise Pahl, a trustee of the UC Santa Barbara Foundation. The overall goal, added Stephen Pahl, remains steadfastly the same: to explore major societal issues using hard data and to develop potential solutions based on empirical evidence. “The purpose of the Pahl Initiative, and now the Pahl Center,” he said, “is to subject knee jerk dogma solutions to critical analysis to see if those reactions are authenticated or supported by quantitative analysis.” “Our campus is immensely grateful to Trustee Louise and Stephen Pahl, both esteemed alumni, for their visionary gift to establish the Pahl Center on the Study of Critical Social Issues,” said Chancellor Henry T. Yang. “The Pahls have supported our university’s upward trajectory for more than 20 years through a series of innovative gifts, and now they have made this momentous pledge and gift to create the Pahl Center, which will become a model — not just across the University of California but also across the country — of the transformative impact of publicly facing social science research. Through their passion and partnership, our campus will expand on our commitment to finding solutions for the most pressing social issues of our time.” Image Photo Credit Courtesy photo Left to right: Pahl Scholars Heather Royer and Clayton Nall, Louise Pahl, Pahl Scholar Tristan Bridges and Stephen Pahl “Philanthropy allows us to dream big and to think outside the box with new ways of making systemic change. The evolution of the initiative into a center reinforces the importance of applied research and plants a stake in the ground for how UC Santa Barbara can fill a unique niche on the national stage. We feel that this is a transformative gift for the Division of Social Sciences and will hopefully inspire others to give generously.” The Pahl Initiative is centered around four key principles: rigorous research of high-stakes social issues; data-driven solutions rooted in research analysis; publicly facing research that reaches beyond the walls and academia; and student involvement in the research process. It has worked perfectly, as the university’s first four Pahl Scholars — one is selected each year — are examining issues ranging from mass shootings, to the pandemic’s impact on the underserved, to the housing crisis, to communication in support of separated Latina/o/x families. The Pahl Center will take these efforts, and social sciences scholarship, to the next level. “It has been my enormous pleasure to work with Louise and Stephen in the creation of the Pahl Initiative which, after a four-year pilot, has proven the concept and now will inspire our efforts to build the Pahl Center,” said Charles Hale, SAGE Sara Miller McCune Dean of Social Sciences at UC Santa Barbara. “The founding premise of our Center is that for every critical social issue we face — from mass shootings, to climate change, to skyrocketing cost of housing and so many more — we need rigorous data-rich analysis of socio-economic and cultural drivers of change, to find just, effective and durable solutions. Our deepest gratitude to Louise and Stephen for their generosity and vision, and for the trust they have deposited in us to raise the Division of Social Sciences to new heights of excellence.” For the Pahls, themselves products of the social sciences at UC Santa Barbara, it’s all about fostering cutting edge research for real world solutions. “Philanthropy allows us to dream big and to think outside the box with new ways of making systemic change,” Louise Pahl said. “The evolution of the initiative into a center reinforces the importance of applied research and plants a stake in the ground for how UC Santa Barbara can fill a unique niche on the national stage. We feel that this is a transformative gift for the Division of Social Sciences and will hopefully inspire others to give generously.” “We’re trying to change the thought process,” added Stephen Pahl. “Our goal is that we’re not the only contributors to the Pahl Center. We want this to be the start of something larger, not something that starts and ends with our gift.” Donors to the campus since 1990, the Pahls have focused their philanthropy on student support, endowing an undergraduate upper division “Making a Difference” award in social sciences and a graduate fellowship that rotates between the departments of political science, economics and sociology. They are members of the Social Sciences Dean’s Cabinet.

Society + Culture May 18, 2023 Humanities program brings courses in literary studies to individuals in the California state prison system Andrea Estrada It’s not the typical classroom situation, but then, these are not typical students. Their life journeys have taken them not to colleges and universities, but to one of the 34 facilities within California’s prison system. Most of them are serving life sentences. And they are participating in Foundations in the Humanities, a correspondence program of UC Santa Barbara’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC), where they explore the world of literature and broaden their perspectives in the process. “Right now, we have 121 students,” said Susan Derwin, director of the IHC and a professor of comparative literature. “We’ve had as many as 160.” The waiting list currently stands at 275, and Derwin expects it to reach 400 this summer. Since the program began in 2016, it has served 873 participants. And now it has garnered special attention from the California State Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which has awarded Foundations in the Humanities a three-year Innovative Programming Grant to work with 60 incarcerated individuals at the California Men’s Prison-Corcoran. The grant covers the cost of instructors who work with the participants, as well as two visits per year to the Corcoran facility. “This award is significant because Foundations does not have an ongoing source of funding that fully supports the program,” Derwin said. “Equally important, it legitimates the educational value of the program in the eyes of the state and establishes our credibility with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. We hope this will enable us to bring more educational programming to people who are incarcerated in California.” IHC Assistant Director Chris Bovbjerg, who manages the program, notes that Foundations in the Humanities offers three courses: “Foundations I: Introduction to Literary Studies,” “Foundations II: Selected Works of American Literature” and “Foundations III: Studies in the Novel.” The courses comprise six modules that each contain a short reading and an accompanying worksheet with six essay questions. According to Bovbjerg, each reading presents situations in which fictional characters confront and respond to significant life situations and challenges of universal relevance. Reading and responding to questions about these literary works enables participants to expand their insight into themselves and their society, for the purpose of building better lives in prison and after their release.

For the last five years, her teaching and writing have been devoted to the issues of social reintegration confronting military veterans and to publicly-engaged humanities. Read more Derwin began developing Foundations in Humanities when a former student who had become incarcerated contacted her about creating a humanities program at the facility where he was confined. Getting a program off the ground proved difficult, however — it was a tough sell to the prison wardens and community resource managers she initially contacted. Fortunately, she found an ally in Sister Mary Sean Hodges, who runs the Partnership for Re-Entry Program, a series of life skills correspondence courses offered by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles County. The courses are designed to improve the odds of success for parolees creating new lives in their communities, and Hodges was already a fixture in the prisons. “I was at a loss, so I contacted Sister Mary,” Derwin said. “She came to the IHC from Los Angeles with three co-workers, all of whom were formerly incarcerated men, and proposed that we become partners. That meant I was able to go into the prison with her and start to teach my classes.” “I love the program of humanities,” Hodges said. “Almost everything all other programs do is prison related — how did I get here, what am I doing to get out of here? But the humanities take the participants to a new realm altogether — how can I be out of prison while I’m still here? “We need this kind of programming because all of us need healing every day from our actions,” Hodges continued. “That comes from looking at our daily circumstances in a new light, looking back at where we came from and looking forward to where we can go. Susan’s programs offer these experiences of ‘where can I go’.” “Almost everything all other programs do is prison related — how did I get here, what am I doing to get out of here? But the humanities take the participants to a new realm altogether — how can I be out of prison while I’m still here? According to Derwin, Hodges prefers to work with people who are serving life sentences because they are “on the path to rehabilitation,” and most of the Foundations in the Humanities students come from that cohort. Some in the program are serving life sentences without the possibility of parole and have been incarcerated for decades. “They find this work incredibly important, because inside the facilities these individuals are often the leaders in the community,” Derwin said. “They set an example for the younger people who are incarcerated about how you live your life — you keep working on yourself, and developing yourself, and training yourself. They’re elders in the prisons. It’s a very articulated and nuanced society where intergenerational relationships have a great impact.” At the time Foundations in the Humanities first began in 2016, Derwin was the sole instructor, joining Hodges on her visits to three prisons in the Central Valley and San Luis Obispo. “We worked with the men in her PREP program,” Derwin said. “I taught a seminar on several yards in each facility, and those who took part and were interested in studying literature through correspondence wrote to me.” It quickly became clear, however, that demand was far more than one professor could manage. So Derwin recruited five humanities graduate students to work with her. “Before we knew it, we had hundreds of people applying to us to enroll,” she said. “That first year we had six graduate instructors and 65 students. And when we finished that class, the students wanted a second one. So, we started ‘Major Works in American Literature.’ And those students wanted a third class, so now we have ‘Studies in the Novel,’ with students reading Zora Neale Hurston’s ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God.’ “By the time the students are going into their third year, they are skilled, critical, reflective readers,” Derwin continued. “And the essay questions they’re given ask them to synthesize and analyze the readings from different perspectives, which they are well prepared to do.” Image Photo Credit Courtesy photo Chris Bovbjerg Foundations in the Humanities is now active in all 34 of California’s state prisons, and the number of incarcerated students accommodated depends on the number of graduate student instructors. Each instructor works with up to 15 students at various facilities. “This year we have had 12 instructors,” Bovbjerg said. “But we’re looking for as many as we can get.” Until now, in addition to support from the Office of the Dean of the Division of Humanities and Fine Arts, funding for the program has come from the UC Humanities Research Institute and from UC Santa Barbara community outreach grants. Now, with the CA Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Grant, it is funded to run at Corcoran for three years. Derwin visited the Corcoran facility last month. “We spent the day there teaching in two yards,” she recalled. “Inside yard 4B there’s a huge wall that has a beautiful image of a globe on a pedestal. Emblazoned across this mural are the words ‘Self-Help University.’ This yard had previously been the SHU, Special Housing Unit, where individuals were put into solitary confinement. The people on the yard decided to reclaim and repurpose it and make it theirs. It’s now Self-Help University, and they’re offering their own diploma inside.” The effects of the Foundations courses ripple beyond the coursework. “It’s generated new kinds of conversations on the yard,” Derwin said. “People get together and talk about the texts. We encourage them to form study groups after they’ve completed their work, to continue the conversation.” And those ripples extend beyond the facility itself, to participants’ relationships with their loved ones. “Almost everyone inside has relationships with some young people — children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews and cousins. The participants become role models,” Derwin continued. “They now talk to their loved ones as students. They model good practices. “Engaging in the process of reading and thinking about the meaning of literature in relation to their own lives, they have more to talk about than what’s happening on the yard or what needs they may have. They have ideas to share, which is empowering and enables them to assume their responsibility in society beyond the prison walls. They experience themselves not as ‘inmates,’ but as thoughtful, socially engaged individuals who have something meaningful to contribute to other people’s lives.” Media Contact Shelly Leachman Editorial Director (805) 893-2191 sleachman@ucsb.edu Share this article About UC Santa Barbara The University of California, Santa Barbara is a leading research institution that also provides a comprehensive liberal arts learning experience.

Science + Technology May 22, 2023 How a drought affects trees depends on what’s been holding them back Harrison Tasoff Droughts can be good for trees. Certain trees, that is. Contrary to expectation, sometimes a record-breaking drought can increase tree growth. Why and where this happens is the subject of a new paper in Global Change Biology . A team of scientists led by Joan Dudney at UC Santa Barbara examined the drought response of endangered whitebark pine over the past century. They found that in cold, harsh environments — often at high altitudes and latitudes — drought can actually benefit the trees by extending the growing season. This research provides insights into where the threats from extreme drought will be greatest, and how different species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. Image Photo Credit Courtesy Photo Download Image Joan Dudney Joan Dudney's research focuses on the causes and consequences of large-scale changes in terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands. These include infectious disease, pest outbreaks, invasive plants and climate change. Read more Many factors can constrain tree growth, including temperature, sunlight and the availability of water and nutrients. The threshold between energy-limited and water-limited systems turns out to be particularly significant. Trees that try to grow in excessively cold temperatures — often energy-limited systems — can freeze to death. On the other hand, too little water can also kill a tree, particularly in water-limited systems. Over time, many tree species have adapted to these extreme conditions, and their responses are broadly similar. They often reduce growth-related activities, including photosynthesis and nutrient uptake, to protect themselves until the weather improves. “Interestingly, the transition from energy- to water-limited growth can produce highly unexpected responses,” explained Dudney, an assistant professor in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the Environmental Studies Program . “In cold, energy-limited environments, extreme drought can actually increase growth and productivity, even in California.” Dudney and her colleagues extracted 800 tree cores from whitebark pine across the Sierra Nevada, comparing the tree rings to historical records of climate conditions. This climate data spanned 1900 to 2018, and included three extreme droughts: 1959–61, 1976–77, and 2012–15. They recorded where tree growth and temperature showed a positive relationship, and where the relationship was negative. The authors found a pronounced shift in growth during times of drought when the average maximum temperature was roughly 8.4° Celsius (47.1° Fahrenheit) between October and May. Above this threshold, extreme drought reduced growth and photosynthesis. Below this temperature, trees grew more in response to drought. “It’s basically, ‘how long is the growing season?’” Dudney said. Colder winters and higher snowpack often lead to shorter growing seasons that constrain tree growth. Even during an extreme drought, many of the trees growing in these extreme environments did not experience high water stress. This surprised the team of scientists, many of whom had observed and measured the unprecedented tree mortality that occurred at slightly lower elevations in the Sierra Nevada. Image Photo Credit Joan Dudney et al. A tree’s location can drastically change its response to environmental changes. Dudney was curious whether drought impacts growth in just the main trunk, or the whole tree. Without more data, the trends they saw could be a result of disparate processes all responding to the drought differently, she explained. Fortunately, whitebark pine retains its needles for roughly eight years. This provided additional data that could address this question. The researchers shifted their attention from dendrology to chemistry. Atoms of the same element can have different weights, or isotopes, thanks to the number of neutrons they contain. Several aspects of a plant’s metabolism can influence the relative abundance of heavy, carbon-13 and light, carbon-12 in tissues such as their leaves and needles. These changes provide a rough guide to the amount of water stress a tree experienced during drought. This was a boon for the researchers, because isotopic data from the pine needles spanned drought and non-drought years. Analyzing needle growth, carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed that the whole tree was affected by the threshold between water-limited and energy-limited systems. Trunk growth, needle growth, photosynthesis and nutrient cycling responded in opposite directions to drought above and below the threshold between energy- and water-limited systems. The future of whitebark pine is highly uncertain. The species — recently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act — faces many threats, including disease, pine beetle infestation and impacts from altered fire regimes. It’s clear from this research that drought and warming will likely exacerbate these threats in water-limited regions, but warming may be beneficial for growth in energy-limited environments. “This research can help develop more targeted conservation strategies,” said Dudney, “to help restore this historically widespread tree species.” Indeed, the pine’s range encompasses a diverse region, stretching from California to British Columbia, and east to Wyoming. Image Photo Credit Joan Dudney Isotopes in pine needles provide more detailed information on how a tree responds to environmental changes. The findings also have implications more broadly. Approximately 21% of forests are considered energy limited, and an even higher percentage can be classified as water limited. So transitions between these two climatic regimes likely occur around the globe. What’s more, the transition seems to have an effect on nitrogen cycling. Trees in water-limited environments appeared to rely less on symbiotic fungi for nitrogen, which is critical for tree growth in harsh, energy-limited environments. “Droughts are leading to widespread tree mortality across the globe,” Dudney said, “which can accelerate global warming.” Deciphering the many ways trees respond to drought will help us better predict where ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and how to develop more targeted strategies to protect our forests.

Students who have reached senior standing are not eligible to transfer to UCSB and may refer to the Graduate Division for graduate degree options. With a transfer admit rate of close to 50% and one third of our incoming class being transfer students, UCSB is a transfer-friendly campus where your educational goals are our top priority. The application for fall admission opens August 1 and is due by November 30 the year prior to transfer. Priority consideration for transfer admission is given to students transferring directly from a California Community College, but applicants from all colleges/universities are welcome to apply. A Comprehensive Look at UCSB Transfer Admissions Detailed information on the transfer admission requirements at UC Santa Barbara, including an overview of the financial aid process. What to Expect When You Transfer The academic experience at UCSB for transfer students is both challenging and stimulating. As you prepare to transfer, know that academic preparation at your current college is the most important factor in admission. Focus on not just meeting minimum junior transfer eligibility but on being a selective applicant with a strong GPA and major preparation coursework completed before you transfer. Completing major preparation coursework will not only make you a stronger applicant, but it will set you up for a smoother transition and path to graduation from UCSB. Transfer Life at UCSB The Transfer Student Center , located in the UCSB Library, offers dedicated academic advising, workshops, and specialized programs to provide you with academic, social, and emotional support.

If the Same Day Advising Queue is closed, we will NOT accept Zoom drop-in requests. SCHEDULE AN ADVISING APPOINTMENT: Use the \" General & Honors Appointments Queue \" on QLess. Click here to see why you might want an appointment . You can choose between Virtual (phone or Zoom) or In Person appointments. Appointments cannot be scheduled for the same or next day, and may be scheduled no more than 2 weeks in advance. If you get the message \"No days available\", this means there currently are no available appointments. Please check back again at a later time or join our Same Day Queue. PRE-PROFESSIONAL ADVISING: Visit the Pre-Health or Pre-Law website on how to schedule an appointment. You can also email questions to us! Make sure to email from your UCSB email if possible, and include your name and perm number with your question(s). Please allow 1-3 business days for a response. General Advising *: academic_advising@Ltsc.ucsb.edu * Our petitions are available online as fillable PDFs and should be submitted to this email. Honors Advising : honorsmail@Ltsc.ucsb.edu Transfer Students Advising : transferadvising@Ltsc.ucsb.edu International Students Advising : intl_students@Ltsc.ucsb.edu Undeclared & Transitions Students Advising: undeclared_advising@Ltsc.ucsb.edu Pre-Health Advising : prehealthinfo@Ltsc.ucsb.edu IMPORTANT: While advisors will be glad to talk to you about courses you're considering, advisors will NOT choose your courses for you or put you into full classes. If a course is full, please use GOLD to get on the waitlist. Click here to learn about how the waitlist works. To find courses that have space, use the Advanced Search feature on GOLD, choose the department and select \"Open Sections Only\". You can also attempt to crash a class by going to the first day of lecture. So while advisors won't pick your classes or get you into a course, if you are having difficulties with your course schedule, we can assist you and provide options to consider (e.g., deficit load or online courses). *Always use QLess to talk to an advisor, either the same day or by appointment.  Same day advising (via phone, Zoom or in person) is available during all the days and times above unless \"appointments only\" is indicated.  If you try to get in line during these times, but QLESS indicates that a \"location\" is closed, please try again later or the next day.  A closed location means that QLess predicts we have reached the maximum number of students that we will be able to talk with though sometimes we get through the list faster than QLess predicts we will. College Advising Mission Academic advisors help students achieve their goals by sharing knowledge and also by partnering with students to analyze their options at UCSB and beyond.  We aim to be an indispensable resource  to connect students with great opportunities and the many sources of support at UCSB that are essential for student success. The Advising Partnership The most successful advising experiences are built on relationships in which the student and advisor work together in mutual responsiveness and commitment.  To build these relationships we encourage students to pursue regular conversations with our advisors.  We also invite students to explore the many online resources that are available. These online materials provide important information regarding requirements as well as programs and opportunities which can greatly enhance the undergraduate experience.  Exploring the online resources can also help students get even more from their meetings with advisors.

Per federal regulations, we will take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunities for all qualified applicants and employees regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services. Equal Opportunity According to Bureau of Labor Statistics projections, the labor force in the United States is projected to increase by 17 million from 2000 to 2010. Statistics further indicate that the fastest rates of increase among workers will be among women and minorities. Therefore, employers must develop recruitment strategies that embrace and mirror these new demographic trends and support workplace equity initiatives. To devise an effective recruiting strategy, one must understand the mission of equal employment opportunity (EEO), the purpose of affirmative action plans and the management and value of diversity initiatives. EEO means freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, color, religion, national origin, disability and age. EEO rights are guaranteed by federal and state fair employment laws and are enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and its state counterparts. Affirmative Action Affirmative action is deemed a moral and social obligation to amend historical wrongs and eliminate the present effects of past discrimination. Affirmative Action Plans (AAPs) define an employer's standard for proactively recruiting, hiring and promoting women, minorities, disabled individuals and veterans. AAP's include numerical measures with the intent of increasing the representation of minorities. Federal contractors above certain dollar limits are required to institute AAP's under Executive Order 11246 and its regulations. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is charged with enforcing contractor affirmative action mandates. Additional information can be found in the 'Guidelines For Addressing Race and Gender Equity in Academic Programs in Compliance with Proposition 209' found at http://www.ucop.edu/general-counsel/_files/guidelines-equity.pdf For more information related to Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action policies, please visit our Policies page .

I am Tara Jones, EOP Academic Achievement Counselor, Coordinator of the AdCRC, doctoral candidate in Depth Psychology, specializing in Community, Liberation, Indigenous, and Eco-Psychologies, and proud Gaucho alum, Class of 2003. As an undergraduate, I double majored in Sociology and Black Studies, from which I graduated with honors and distinction in the major. As a first-generation college student and child of immigrant parents, I took full advantage of many of the amazing opportunities that UCSB had to offer and developed a commitment to service to my peers through serving as a: two-year Resident Assistant, CLAS Writing Tutor, Disabled Students Services Note-taker and Test Proctor, Student Assistant in the Center for Research in Black Studies, Course Assistant in the Sociology Department, and a member of the security team at Davidson Library. I also studied abroad in the United Kingdom through the Education Abroad Program. After graduating from UCSB, I joined Teach for America and taught English Language Arts and Global History & Geography at a secondary school in Harlem, New York, while completing a Masters in the Science of Teaching at Fordham University and training developing teachers as a Cooperating Teacher with the City University of New York’s student teacher training program.  Thereafter, I returned to UCSB as an EOP Counselor and Resident Director of Anacapa Hall and San Rafael Hall. After completing my professional tenure at UCSB, I completed a Masters in Counseling Psychology, specializing in Depth Psychology at Pacifica Graduate Institute. I also served as a facilitator of social-emotional learning in public, private, and junior college settings throughout the Santa Barbara community. Later, I became a psychotherapist in non-profit community mental health settings, working with teens and with diverse individuals experiencing homelessness, as well as other mental health and substance abuse issues. As a scholar, I research, present, and publish on the topics of: teacher well-being, Pan-African traditions of  educational fugitivity, revolutionary black mothering, state violence and black maternal necropolitics, healing from racial injustice, legacies of transnational African diasporic research, and African-centered psychologies. My forthcoming scholastic work is being published in the peer-reviewed journal, Meridians: race, feminism, transnationalism. My visual art has been featured on the covers of the National Political Science Review, a publication of the National Conference of Black Political Science, as well as other venues. Having come full circle, I am honored to come home to my alma mater to once again serve my fellow Gauchos, and to pay forward the gifts of mentorship, guidance, and support that the professional staff and faculty members at UCSB gave to me. I invite you to make full use of the African diasporic Cultural Resource Center, our space, peer mentorship, and programs, and to take advantage of the benefits that EOP provides through our holistic counseling services. No matter where you are from or where your ancestral roots lie within and beyond the African diaspora, there is a special place for you in EOP and at the AdCRC!

AlloSphere - Who we are Welcome to the AlloSphere Research Facility, located in California NanoSystems Institue (CNSI) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) . \n  \t\tThe AlloSphere research group is directed by Distinguished Professor and Chief Scientist Dr. JoAnn Kuchera-Morin .  \n  \t\tThe research group includes computer scientists, designers, engineers, mathematicians, and media arts researchers.\n  \t\tMembers of the AlloSphere Research Group are affiliated with the Media Arts & Technology (MAT) ,graduate program at UCSB. Dr. JoAnn Kuchera-Morin along with excerpts from UCTV Intersecting Science, Engineering, and the Arts Dr. JoAnn Kuchera-Morin, chief designer of the facility, composer, and media artist with over thirty years of experience in media systems engineering, outlines the vision for our research. In representing complex and real-world scenarios on computational platforms, a number of data types come into play, including real data from scientific instruments, simulations on that data, as well as mathematical equations as a result of previous years of experimentation and simulation. Reenacting these complex holistic systems interactively and in real time leads to the possibility of new scientific discoveries as well as new forms of art and entertainment, the interactive cinema of the future and real-world simulations of “nature as it could be,” not nature as it is. Kuchera-Morin,JoAnn. Letter to Newton Harrison. 11 Feb. 2022. Personal collection of JoAnn Kuchera-Morin. AlloSphere - What we do The AlloSphere is a three-story facility where we use multiple modalities to represent large and complex data, including immersive visualization, sonification, and interactivity. We are creating technology that will enable experts to use their intuition and experience to examine and interact with complex data to identify patterns, suggest and test theories in an integrated loop of discovery. Important research areas include quantum information processing and structural materials discovery, bioengineering and biogenerative applications, and arts and entertainment. These content areas also drive media systems research in immersive display, computation, and interactivity. The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber. Think of the AlloSphere as a large, dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer. Twenty (20) researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere, and be completely immersed in their data. Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin. Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. Kuchera-Morin, J. (2009, October). Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere  [Video]. TED Conferences. https://www.ted.com/talks/joann_kuchera_morin_stunning_data_visualization_in_the_allosphere Dr. JoAnn Kuchera-Morin @ TED The AlloShere Facility The AlloSphere is three stories, 26 projectors, & 54.1 Channels of sound. Our facility is differentiated from other virtual reality environments by both its seamless surround-view capabilities and its ability to accommodate large groups of researchers concurrently. Building the AlloSphere was not an off-the-shelf enterprise. Designing a large-scale environment to deliver rich, coherent, interactive, high-resolution 3D video and audio streams from massive scientific datasets is a complex computational and systems engineering task that continues to involve faculty across a variety of disciplines. A history Dr. Kuchera-Morin worked with renowned architect Robert Venturi from 2001-2003 to plan the AlloSphere within the 62,000 square foot California NanoSystems Institute building (Elings Hall) at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  McKay Conant Hoover, Inc. served as the acoustical consultant firm, while Auerbach and Associates were involved in the visual consulting process.  During the extensive meetings with the architects and design consultants the construction plans for the instrument underwent many changes as nothing like this facility had ever been built before. AlloSphere - The team wants to work with you. As media artists we know that correctly representing complex models and data leads also to increased artistic sophistication.  The work we present is only as good as the content it is derived from. If you are a researcher facing challenges in representing your data, please contact us. We would like to help you look for new patterns in your data and speed time to discovery.

Situated in the Department of English at UC Santa Barbara, the American Cultures & Global Contexts Center (ACGCC) collaborates on research and teaching initiatives spanning literary studies, comparative ethnic studies, and transnational American studies. Yayoi Kusama, Fire, ca. 1954, watercolor, pastel, ink, tempera on paper, Smithsonian American Art Museum. This year we learn from and build upon the global imagination of racial justice . Through smoke-filled skies, 2020 lights up a clear vision as protest and pandemic strip power to its barest forms. The essential among us and the most vulnerable are made expendable, as oligarchy is revealed to sustain only itself. A global imagination of racial justice addresses racist dynamics from our proximate lives to their broader manifestation in U.S. empire even as it supports the unprecedented awareness and solidarity of people around the world and their determination—through ingenuity, vision, and care—to chart a path forward. Centering art, creative imagination, and literary politics, our 2020–22 programming bridges ethnic studies as well as postcolonial and decolonial critique. What inspires us to hope and action in these disheartening times? Where can we find language and ideas that sharpen thought and motivate praxis? How can we create a common social agenda out of our different histories, identifications, experiences, and investments? The ACGCC invites you to join us in study, reflection, and conversation as we seek common ground from which to meaningfully address our collective present. Undergraduate Students Explore how different aspects of American culture interact and interrogate the ways regional, hemispheric, and global trends shape and are shaped by American cultural expressions. All undergrads, regardless of their major are encouraged to attend our events. English majors at UCSB may pursue the American Cultures & Global Contexts specialization . Graduate Students Graduate students interested in multiethnic, antiracist, and intersectional approaches to American Studies participate in ACGCC in many capacities. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to explore our programming and contact our Graduate Student Fellow .

Capps Center Giving Minor in American Indian and Indigenous Studies The American Indian and Indigenous Studies Minor is designed to give students an understanding of the ideas, practices, experiences, and issues confronting native peoples of North and South America through the study of their histories, environment, cultures, languages, politics, and economies. The minor, available to all students, recognizes the significance of indigenous languages and cultures as an important part of the heritage of all American peoples. The focus of the minor at UCSB builds on the historic strengths of a variety of disciplines in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. DOWNLOAD MINOR REQUIREMENTS All courses (see course descriptions) to be applied to the minor must be completed on a letter-grade basis. This includes preparatory and upper-division courses offered by the Department of Religious Studies and those offered by other departments. Note: Substitutions and waivers are subject to approval by the department. Check catalog course descriptions for prerequisites or other departmental restrictions. See “Academic Minors” for special conditions governing minors in the College of Letters and Science. FAQs How do I declare a minor? The student must initiate the process by consulting with the sponsoring department. At present, there is no formal process to “declare” a minor, but the department will have the requirements sheet for the minor and will start the process. To receive recognition for completing a minor, the student must notify the sponsoring department early in the final quarter – when candidacy for the bachelor’s degree is declared. You should bring a print-out of your Academic Record from GOLD and documentation of any accepted transfer work you intend to use for the minor. Is there a deadline for filing the minor? The deadline to declare candidacy is normally the third week of the quarter. The department will prepare a clearance form for you and send the form to the Registrar. (You should inform the department early in your final quarter even if you are still completing courses toward the minor.) A minor can be filed with the Registrar up to one month after you complete your undergraduate degree. Can I request an exception/substitution to one of the requirements for the minor? There is no petition form to use for exceptions for a minor. Instead, discuss your request with the faculty advisor and/or department. If the request is approved, it will be noted on the official clearance form prepared by the sponsoring department. Will the minor appear on my diploma? Once the sponsoring department has grades for all your courses, they will forward the minor clearance form with the appropriate faculty signature to the Registrar. The minor will then appear on your diploma and transcript. Who should I contact about the minor? Please contact our Undergraduate Program Coordinator, Kailee Lencioni .

The combined square footage of the two ARC animal facilities is approximately 22,000 square feet. The newest facility is a rodent barrier facility, and the older facility is a conventional multi-species facility. In addition to the animal holding and animal support area (e.g., cage washing), these facilities contain dedicated and shared animal surgical areas, necropsy rooms, and animal procedure rooms. Veterinary Care The veterinary care program at UCSB is overseen by a full-time Attending Veterinarian. Trained animal technicians or research staff monitor the health of the animal colony on a daily basis, including weekends and holidays. A veterinarian is available (on-call) after-hours, weekends, and holidays for emergency care. The contact information for the veterinarian is posted in the vivarium and is listed below. Any animal showing symptoms of disease, pain, or distress, either spontaneously or after an experimental procedure, should be promptly reported to the veterinarian. The veterinarian notes initial observations, health evaluations, diagnosis, and recommends a treatment or resolution plan. The PI or a member of the research team is notified (by phone or email) to ensure that the proposed treatment plan does not interfere with the experimental treatments/manipulations and must respond to the veterinarian’s treatment request within 24 hours to ensure timely resolution of clinical problems. In most cases treatment is initiated right away. In cases of emergency, or when there is severe pain, distress, or an illness not addressed specifically in the approved protocol, then the PI understands and agrees to allow the veterinarian or designee to provide emergency veterinary care (or euthanasia) without their explicit consent. This agreement is affirmed by the PI as one of the conditions of their animal protocol approval.

        "body": "Applied Linguistics - UC Santa Barbara Skip to main content Applied Linguistics - UC Santa Barbara Main menu Requirements Courses People News FAQ Search Welcome to Applied Linguistics Applied Linguistics is a growing and vibrant discipline in universities nationally and internationally. It is an interdisciplinary field of research and instruction that provides theoretical and descriptive foundations for the empirical investigation and solution of language-related issues, especially those of language education (first-language, second-language, foreign-language and heritage-language teaching and learning), but also issues of bilingualism and biliteracy, language policy, language assessment, translation and interpretation, lexicography, rhetoric and composition. Students who demonstrate competence in these areas increase their opportunities for employment, as many job descriptions indicate a preference for candidates with an emphasis in applied linguistics or second language acquisition. Also, with the ever-increasing number of second language learners at the PreK-20 levels, it is essential for all teachers and educational researchers to have a fundamental understanding of language learning and teaching theories and practices. The Ph.D. Emphasis in Applied Linguistics has been key to my transformation from Chinese-language student to Chinese-language teacher. In both coursework and independent study, the Applied Linguistics faculty have introduced me to the theories behind second language acquisition and helped me consider how to match my teaching to the needs of my students. This training has helped me gain confidence in my teaching, particularly as a non-native speaker. Furthermore, the pedagogical principals that I have acquired are applicable not only to language courses, but have also guided me in designing and teaching courses on literature and culture. I would strongly recommend this program to any graduate student considering language instruction as part of his or her career. ~Cara Healey, 2017 PhD The applied linguistics emphasis at UCSB has been absolutely necessary for the research I became involved in. Without it, my work on teaching a native language of California as a second language would have been impossible. The emphasis has both practical and scholarly applications in that it may nicely complement one's research interests in unexpected as well as expected ways. ~Timothy Henry, PhD 2012 The Emphasis in Applied Linguistics has been been an excellent addition to my PhD in Linguistics and has provided me with interesting coursework outside my department, much needed pedagogical overviews on language teaching, and opportunities to work on other kinds of projects, such as an electronic dictionary source for an indigenous language, overall leading to a greater breadth in my knowledge. Ultimately, it was this additional emphasis which landed me my current job! ~Carmen Jany, PhD 2008 Adding the emphasis in Applied Linguistics to my Ph.D. in Luso-Brazilian Literature was one of the best steps I took during my time at UCSB.  Language teaching methodology had been one of my main areas of research and teaching, and the Emphasis allowed to significantly expand that interest.  I particularly cherished the opportunity to research in the area of multimedia learning in the context of the language class, using the work with my own classes.  I believe I learned a lot, from specific and up-to-date tools to a general theoretical framework.  In this work I always felt I was guided by faculty who were extremely dedicated to their work and their students.  Eventually this research opened a path for publications.  Finally, I think the emphasis in Applied Linguistics was of great value when I went on the job market, and in fact it helped me prepare for many of the challenges I met in my job. ~ Ricardo Vasconcelos, PhD 2010 Announcements New PhD!

The Army ROTC program at UCSB is not only academically demanding, but is well known throughout the nation as one of the top ROTC units.  Westmont College, Santa Barbara City College and California State University at Channel Islands are affiliates of the Army ROTC program at UCSB.  ROTC students from all three (3) affiliated schools attend the same Military Science courses as UCSB students, and participate in all ROTC events.  Being a student at UCSB, Westmont College, California State University at Channel Islands or Santa Barbara City College, and learning to become a leader will make your college experience even richer and prepare you for a successful future. About Army ROTC is one of the oldest organization at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  The program began in 1947 when all incoming Freshmen and Sophomores were required to become Cadets.  In 1962, the compulsory enrollment ended at UC and the voluntary Cadet Corps was established. The Surfrider Battalion’s mission, led by its dedicated and professional Cadre, is to recruit and retain quality Cadets and develop them physically, mentally, and emotionally into Officers worthy of leading our nation’s Soldiers and commanding the Army of the future.

It is unacceptable that the University of California's current salary rates create conditions in which students spend well over 50% of their monthly salary for rent, live in their cars and rely on local food banks for themselves and their families. The HAA faculty greatly value our graduate students and the key role they play in teaching and creating knowledge, and we recognize them as essential participants in our university community and the mission of the public university.

Dr. Berry is a distinguished scholar of African American History, previously holding the Oliver Radkey Regents Professorship of History at the University of Texas, Austin.  She will be a visionary and inspiring campus leader. Visit Dr. Berry's Website Read the Chancellor's Announcement HFA Racial Justice Action Statement and Plan More than ever, California, the nation, and the world need engaged and informed citizens who understand the languages, traditions, values, and histories of our diverse communities and cultures. The disruption and losses of the pandemic, and the inequities it made starkly visible, have brought that lesson home with force. Globalization, along with cultural diversity, and racial justice at home call for the knowledge and comparative methods of the humanities. These methods are essential to sustaining multicultural and multilingual societies, to dismantling structural racism, and to cultivating a strong democratic culture.

Fujino on her new book, Contemporary Asian American Activism: Building Movements for Liberation . From the publisher's summary: \"In the struggles for prison abolition, global anti-imperialism, immigrant rights, affordable housing, environmental justice, fair labor, and more, twenty-first-century Asian American activists are speaking out and standing up to systems of oppression. Creating emancipatory futures requires collective action and reciprocal relationships that are nurtured over time and forged through cross-racial solidarity and intergenerational connections, leading to a range of on-the-ground experiences. Bringing together grassroots organizers and scholar-activists, Contemporary Asian American Activism presents lived experiences of the fight for transformative justice and offers lessons to ensure the longevity and sustainability of organizing. In the face of imperialism, white supremacy, racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, ableism, and more, the contributors celebrate victories and assess failures, reflect on the trials of activist life, critically examine long-term movement building, and inspire continued mobilization for coming generations.\" Professor Fujino co-edited this new book with Robyn Magalit Rodriguez , professor and chair of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis. Department Spotlight Our department would like to give a special shout out to one of our majors, Felix Dong, for publishing his opinion piece This Can’t Keep Happening: Anti-Asian Incidents in the The Bottom Line (March 3, 2022), UCSB's student-run newspaper. In his article, Felix discusses how traumatic the rise in anti-Asian incidents have been on the Asian American community in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. He goes on to describe anti-Asian hate crimes in recent history, both in the US and on the UCSB campus. For these reasons, Felix argues, \"[w]e cannot keep hearing these names on the news, sending our prayers, and continuing this cycle.\" He encourages his readers to take action, from calling their representatives to volunteering with community organizations. Most importantly, he argues, we must \"spread awareness and talk about what is happening...We must talk about racism and address it, however uncomfortable it may be. These uncomfortable conversations mean addressing our own internal bias, vulnerabilities, and trauma but are also an opportunity for us to come together as a community.\" Thank you, Felix, for your illuminating article! We hope it drives more community members to have difficult conversations and take action against anti-Asian hate.

This site is intended to help everyone -- faculty, students, and our community: know what our University’s educational goals are; understand how UCSB programs examine themselves in continuous cycles of assessment to inform their curriculum structures and teaching strategies; and explore current samples of student achievement in these areas. Assessment of all degree-granting programs at UCSB is required to maintain our standing as a federally accredited public university. Assessment begins with clear educational goals : the knowledge, skills, and values that faculty and programs  aim to foster with students. We call these goals “Program Learning Outcomes” (or PLOs), and faculty develop these within their undergraduate majors and graduate programs. Program Learning Outcomes Regular, ongoing assessments allow each program on campus to examine how it is performing based on the learning outcomes that they establish for students (under the larger banner of UCSB’s mission). Program Learning Outcome assessments are faculty-driven, empowering educators in each department to decide what areas in their programs need current attention and would benefit from structured data about student experiences (“indirect” evidence) and observable learning (“direct” evidence). Assessment How-To In addition to programs’ internal PLO assessments, UCSB collects campus-wide data on student demographic profiles, retention, graduation rates, and other indicators of institutional health. We also survey our students regularly for direct feedback on their educational experience. These data help us to pinpoint areas of strength and opportunities for better supporting our students’ success. Data & Results UCSB departments/programs also conduct regular program reviews  for more comprehensive multi-stage evaluations and reports. These reports are then used for institutional planning, resource allocation, and departmental self-reflection. Program Review The assessment team is a hands-on, community-minded group dedicated to supporting and enriching UCSB’s learning environment for faculty and students alike.

Bike Shop will only be open Wednesday and Friday in an effort to start relocating to the new bike shop space. Within the near future, expect a month-long closure as we prepare for the opening of the new building. The Associated Students Bike Shop, serving the UCSB community since 1975, is a student funded nonprofit organization dedicated to education, service, and safety. Our shop is run by a team of passionate students who provide repairs and resources to get the UCSB community’s bicycles running smoothly. In addition to functioning as a full service bicycle repair shop, the A.S. Bike Shop is dedicated to empowering our campus’ cycling community. The shop also partners with a number of organizations focused on bicycling and sustainability, participating in annual events on campus such as Bike to Work Day, the Zero Waste Festival, and the Bike Fair. Because the A.S. Bike Shop’s culture prioritizes co-learning, empowerment, and inclusion, working at the shop transforms many staff members’ sense of identity. People who had never picked up a wrench prior to being hired come to envision themselves as makers and problem solvers, capable of any variety of repair. We are proud to do our part to break down barriers within the bicycling industry, making the trade of bicycle repair accessible and welcoming to a diverse group of people. The A.S Bike Shop is composed of student mechanics who’ve developed an expansive knowledge under the shop’s direction. Mechanics are able to apply and develop their knowledge and skills while also being able to use their position as a student to help other students. Therefore, don’t be afraid to ask questions!

Our faculty and PhD students specialize in three subfields: archaeology, sociocultural anthropology, and Integrative Anthropological Sciences (evolutionary, biological and cultural). We offer BA degrees with an emphasis in archaeology, biological anthropology, sociocultural anthropology and a general anthropology degree covering all emphasis subfields. For over half a century, the Department of Anthropology at UCSB has been an active and vibrant center of research, mentorship and teaching. We invite you to join us. Why We Do It Anthropology looks deeply into the human experience, into what make us uniquely human. The study take us into the past to explore how we lived and evolved into who we are today. It helps us understand not just our universal past and present, the sameness that unifies us, but helps all global citizens appreciate the immense diversity of human experiences on our planet today. By studying anthropology, we investigate the impacts our past and present have had on ourselves socially, physically, culturally, biologically and ecologically. These lessons are vital tools to understanding how we will shape the future. Where We Work Our faculty, graduate students and undergraduates engage in research all over the globe. Currently, our sites can be found in over 30 countries.

Qualified majors will be invited to participate in the Anthropology Honors Program. Minimum qualifications are junior standing (completion of at least 105 units), completion of at least 20 upper-division units in anthropology, and a grade-point average of at least 3.4. Students must enroll in ANTH 195A during Spring Quarter of their Junior Year . Each candidate for honors then enrolls in Anthropology 195 B & C taken in consecutive quarters, under the instruction of a thesis advisor chosen by the student and approved by the department. In 195A, the student will formulate a research problem that they will pursue for the duration of the program and begin to conduct background research that will frame their research project. In 195B, the student will concentrate on reading and gathering material for the thesis. Lastly in 195C, the student will write the thesis. The Anthropology Honors thesis will be retained permanently in the department office for faculty and students to read. Anthropology students who complete the honors program, maintain grades of B or better in Anthropology 195A, B & C and graduate with a minimum 3.4 grade-point average in the major will be awarded Distinction in the Major on university records and on their diploma.

Further specialization is possible within each of these fields. The archaeology program is committed to providing students with a broad understanding of anthropological archaeology while also providing opportunities for the development of scholarly expertise in particular theoretical, methodological, and geographic areas. Faculty research interests include political economy, identity politics, empires, culture contact and interaction, secondary state formation, cultural ecology, and human behavioral ecology. Student and faculty researchers pursue these interests globally with particular emphasis placed on the archaeology of Andean South America, southern Germany, northern Africa, eastern North America, Coastal California, and Mesoamerica. Methodological interests include epigraphy, archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, ceramic analysis, lithic analysis,and architectural and spatial analysis. Learn more about the Archaeology Specialization Graduate study in UCSB’s IAS program offers a unique combination of strengths conducive to discovery in areas of human behavior, culture, psychology, and health. First, an emphasis on past selection pressures illuminates the evolutionary bases of human phenotypic design and variation. Second, more than any other social science, anthropology is in a position to capitalize on rich ethnographic fieldwork to catalyze fruitful interactions between theory development and empirical data. Third, life-history perspectives offered at UCSB provide a powerful framework for analyzing variation in human growth, development, reproduction, aging, and mortality. Fourth, psychological approaches are emphasized to highlight the cognitive underpinnings of behavioral adaptations. Finally, a commitment to a fully interdisciplinary approach, and ties to other Centers throughout the University, allow both first-rate anthropological research and genuine contributions across the broad range of human sciences. Learn more about the Integrative Anthropological Sciences Specialization Our program uses the theories and methods of social and cultural anthropology to examine contemporary processes related to the changing global order. Our goal is to prepare students to participate in these matters both as scholars and as engaged citizens. Our programmatic emphases center on the cultural and social dimensions of such issues as distribution and inequality, production and reproduction, citizenship and statecraft, human-environmental interactions, religion, and media from the perspective of an engaged anthropology.  Core and affiliated faculty conduct research in Asia, including India, Japan, and China, and the Americas, from the Brazilian Amazon and Central America to the United States, Mexico, California, and “borderlands.” Learn more about the Sociocultural Anthropology Specialization Optional Interdisciplinary PhD Emphases Programs Optional Interdisciplinary PhD emphases are available in: Ancient Mediterranean Studies Cognitive Science Demography Environment and Society Feminist Studies Global and International Studies Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) Technology and Society Department of Anthropology University of California Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3210 Phone: 805-893-2257 Department Main Office Humanities and Social Sciences Building (HSSB) 2001 Main Office Hours Monday through Thursday 9am-12pm and 1-4pm Friday 9am-12pm Department Chair Casey Walsh Map to Anthropology Parking College of Letters and Science UC Santa Barbara Accessibility Appropriate Use Privacy Webmaster ©2023 The Regents of the University of California.

No matter how large or how small, every gift makes a difference. Click here to give to the General Anthropology Fund . Specific Giving Opportunities Several funds have been established to support specific department activities as some donors prefer to designate their gifts for a specific purpose. The Friends of Anthropology We invite you to join the Friends of Anthropology, UCSB's support group dedicated to sponsoring graduate student research and education. The UCSB Department of Anthropology is one of the top programs in the country, with some of the most exceptional graduate students in the field. Our students and faculty work throughtout Latin America, Egypt and the Sudan, South Asia, and the United States. Join the Friends and help support the next generation of outstanding anthropological research at UCSB. Click here to give to the Friends of Anthropology . The Peter F. Paige Memorial Fund Contributions in memory of Peter Paige fund an annual award in his name celebrating Peter’s interest in the prehistory of the Santa Barbara Channel and the archaeology of Santa Cruz Island. Peter was a graduate student researching prehistoric Island Chumash fishing practices at the time of his untimely death in 2004. His focus was faunal analysis, seasonality and prehistoric maritime cultures on the Channel Islands. The fund was inaugurated in 2006 and the first award recipient was selected in 2007. To give to the Peter F. Paige Memorial Fund, please click here to reach the General Anthropology Fund and note this fund in the Comments section. The Charles J. Erasmus Fund The Charles J. Erasmus fund was established by UCSB Department of Anthropology emeritus faculty in memory of the late Professor of Anthropology Charles J. Erasmus in recognition of his scholarship and service. Dr. Erasmus came to UC Santa Barbara in 1962 as the first chair of the Anthropology Department. During its early days, he directed the department’s scientific focus to areas of materialist, evolutionary, and economic development research. He devoted much of his career to understanding the conditions under which individuals commit to the public welfare and was a pioneer in peasant studies, medical anthropology, development anthropology (especially community development and anthropology’s role in foreign aid), and experimental archaeology. As a faculty member at UCSB from 1962 to 1987, he supervised and worked with many doctoral students, who found him to be an inspiring teacher. Dr. Erasmus died September 5, 2012. The primary objective of this fund is to support qualified graduate students to visit a future field site to strengthen proposals for doctoral research at that site. Awards are to be given only for research focusing on areas championed by Dr. Erasmus: materialist, evolutionary, or in the field of economic development. Click here to give to The Charles J. Erasmus Fund . The Brian Fagan Fund for Public Anthropology Our discipline is at an important crossroads in which we must make our research, writing, and presentation more relevant to public education and discourse. It is only through demonstrating our broader relevance to local and global perspectives on cultural practices, human-environment interactions, long-term human adaptations, political and economic change, etc., that we can make substantive and sustained impacts on modern social life and educational outcomes for students and laypeople from myriad backgrounds. As one of the most prolific writers of best-selling non-fiction works within an anthropological paradigm, Dr. Fagan is one of the discipline’s most well-known public faces. The fund, in recognition of Dr. Fagan’s significant contributions to public anthropology, is to support graduate student research that is related to some form of public outreach or engagement. Examples include funds to support research that leadsto a publication in a publicly accessible non-academic venue; develop curricular materials for K-12 schools; develop workshops to enhance public participation in anthropological research; produce tools and resources for public engagement via social media; and create public exhibits and/or museum guides on an anthropological topic. The fund will also reward graduate students who demonstrate that they have recently engaged in these types of significant public outreach activities. To give to the Brian Fagan Fund, please click here to reach the General Anthropology Fund and note this fund in the Comments section. Amerindian Indigenous Peoples Health Fund The Amerindian Indigenous Peoples Health Fund at the University of California-Santa Barbara exists to help serve the health needs of indigenous populations in South America who lack access to medical care. Infectious disease remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in much of rural South America, and donations help support initiatives to provide medical attention to those in need. We also help coordinate treatment for more complicated problems, including hernia surgeries, colposcopies (for abnormal PAP smears) to prevent cervical cancer, cataract and pterigion surgeries to help correct vision. These are done in coordination with local Bolivian NGOs and hospitals. All donations go directly to help diagnose and cure indigenous people and to develop further health awareness, as there are no overhead nor administrative costs.  At present, funds help support Tsimane and Mosetene Amerindians of Bolivia. More information about the Tsimane Health and Life History Project can be found here . For any questions, please contact Dr. Michael Gurven at gurven@anth.ucsb.edu .

In recent years, this has increased demand for fieldwork-based studies, often involving researchers from North America and Europe collecting data from communities within relatively low-income nations. In a new paper in Nature Human Behavior, an international team of social scientists emphasizes that as interest in fieldwork-based studies continues to grow, researchers must also do more to forge equitable collaborative partnerships.

        "body": "A Drop in Temperature | Department of Anthropology - UC Santa Barbara Skip to main content University of California, Santa Barbara Department of Anthropology - UC Santa Barbara Main menu About People Graduate Undergraduate Research News & Events Services & Resources Forms Give A Drop in Temperature In the nearly two centuries since German physician Carl Wunderlich established 98.6 ° F as the standard “normal” body temperature, it has been used by parents and doctors alike as the measure by which fevers — and often the severity of illness — have been assessed. Over time, however, and in more recent years, lower body temperatures have been widely reported in healthy adults. A 2017 study among 35,000 adults in the United Kingdom found average body temperature to be lower (97.9 ° F), and a 2019 study showed that the normal body temperature in Americans (those in Palo Alto, California, anyway) is about 97.5 ° F. A multinational team of physicians, anthropologists and local researchers led by Michael Gurven, UC Santa Barbara professor of anthropology and chair of the campus’s Integrative Anthropological Sciences Unit , and Thomas Kraft, a postdoctoral researcher in the same department, have found a similar decrease among the Tsimane, an indigenous population of forager-horticulturists in the Bolivian Amazon. In the 16 years since Gurven, co-director of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project , and fellow researchers have been studying the population, they have observed a rapid decline in average body temperature — 0.09 ° F per year, such that today Tsimane body temperatures are roughly 97.7 ° F.

The first is anthropological political economy, with a focus on the Mexico-US borderlands. Throughout my career I have studied the ways in which water, land and labor have been organized to produce commodities in areas marked by aridity, especially northern Mexico and the US southwest, including California. In my first book (Building the Borderlands) I show how a regime of accumulation based in irrigated cotton agriculture gave form to borderlands infrastructure, society and culture. After that I published a book on how mineral springs have been used, managed and conceptualized over the long durée in Mexico (Virtuous Waters). I chronicle enduring understandings of water as heterogeneous and effective, and suggest that these water cultures can form the basis of both collective sustainability and increased commoditization. Recently I have turned my attention to the use and management of groundwater for agriculture in California, and am conducting an ethnographic study of how new legislation - the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) - is being enacted in the Central Coast region of that state. The other major thrust of my research concerns the history of anthropological thought, and I approach anthropological concepts and discussions as a cultural formation that takes shape in particular political and economic contexts. I am particularly interested in perspectives that have developed outside of Europe and North America, and have published work on different traditions within Latin American Anthropology, how these traditions are linked to broader transnational dialogues, and how they have been applied to development and state formation. Recent book chapter: \"Water to Wine: Industrial Agriculture and Groundwater Regulation in California\" BUILDING THE BORDERLANDS: A TRANSNATIONAL HISTORY OF IRRIGATED COTTON ALONG THE MEXICO-TEXAS BORDER VIRTUOUS WATERS: MINERAL SPRINGS, BATHING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEXICO Projects : Groundwater and Grapes in California’s Central Coast (2014–present) This project assesses expanding wine grape cultivation on groundwater management in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. Particular attention is given to the recent capitalization of the sector, the depletion of aquifers, and the ensuing creation and implementation of laws regulating groundwater in California. It situates the local social and environmental dimensions of the expansion of wine grape production within global markets and climate change. The Social Use of Hot Springs (2010–present) Mineral Springs have always been a central focus of the world’s different water cultures, but have received almost no attention from social scientists. This project investigates the social use and culture of mineral springs in Mexico and California, and problems concerning: 1) access; 2) infrastructure; 3) bathing; and 4) environmental values. Water, Agriculture and Society in the Mexican Borderlands (2001-present) This project studies the history and current condition of water in the Mexico-United States Border region. Attention is placed on the history of cotton, and subsequent development of high-value crops. It analizes the social and economic effects caused in urban and rural sectors by water scarcity, as well as the changes to social and physical infrastructures.

Our faculty foster communities of inquiry and free speech based in self-awareness, individual responsibility, and an informed world view. We encourage divergent opinion and cogent argument, believing lively debate, exposure to differing viewpoints, and a certain level of discomfort are essential to intellectual and artistic growth. In our classes, students will be shown work and introduced to theories and practices that may challenge their beliefs and assumptions. Students are expected to think critically rather than react impulsively; to consider opposing viewpoints and others’ opinions and experiences with openness and thoughtfulness; and to engage in a manner befitting themselves as artists and scholars in this university, an institution of higher learning. © 2023 The Regents of the University of California .

The best time to visit is when classes are in session. Please contact the Staff Graduate Advisor to arrange a tour. We also have created a virtual tour that you can view to get a great summary of our facilities and studios. Can I hear from current students about their experiences? You are welcome to contact the Staff Graduate Advisor for assistance in connecting with current graduate students. How competitive is the admission process? The total number of students in the two year program is about 12-16. Out of 90-100 complete applications, we accept 5-9 students per year. Is a BFA required to apply to the MFA program? No, it is not required, but applicants should have an undergraduate degree with some emphasis in visual studies, although this is not necessary. We feel artists can come from a broad spectrum of interests. Is there an application fee waiver? A limited number of fee waivers are available for qualified US citizens and permanent residents who demonstrate financial need. McNair Scholars and Project 1000 applicants are among those eligible. Fee waivers are not available to international applicants. Within your application click on the Payment Information tab and scroll-down to the fee waiver information. Submit your request online by selecting the option relevant to you and uploading your supporting documentation. You must submit your fee waiver request at least two weeks before the application deadline. Can I submit my application if my letters of recommendation have not been uploaded? We require LORs to be submitted to both your UCSB application and to your Slideroom application. Please submit your applications prior to the deadline of January 3, 2023. Your recommenders can still submit their letters afterwards, but they must be received by Friday, January 6, at the absolute latest, in order to be reviewed by the admissions committee. When and how will I be notified of my admissions decision? You may receive an email or phone call if you are being considered for admission as early as the middle of January, or as late as the end of April. Official offers of admission or denials will be available to the applicant on their UCSB application. An email will be sent to the applicant when the decision can be viewed. If you need information about your status before you have heard anything from either the department or the University, please email the Staff Graduate Advisor . How do our facilities compare to other liberal arts colleges and art schools? We are told every year when prospective students visit that they had no idea we had such fantastic facilities to make work and that our studios are larger than most. All students have access to large, private studio spaces which are located on campus. Studios range in size from 250sqft to 450sqft, and there is substantial shared common space available for events and additional storage. In addition to 24/7 access to the graduate studios, the following labs are open to graduate students: woodshop, digital print studio, printmaking, sculpture yard, foundry (metal and mold making) and computer/digital arts lab. Are Teaching Assistantships available? Usually, we can offer TA positions at 25% time (approximately 10 hours per week) to our graduate students if we have the funding, and the student is qualified to teach. These positions come with partial fee remission for California resident tuition and fees, and a salary of approximately $3,342 per quarter.  Historically, the department has been able to provide all of our MFAs who aren’t already receiving tuition/fee remission through central campus fellowships with employment as Teaching Assistants for all registered quarters in the program. For more details, see “what is the total cost of the program” tab below.  For more information please refer to the Graduate Division website . When/how to apply for financial aid? Applicants can fill out the FAFSA form online at https://fafsa.ed.gov by March 2. The school code for UCSB is 1320. See Financial Aid for more details. What is the total cost of program? For academic year 2016-17 CA resident tuition and fees are $13,248, out of state tuition and fees are $28,350. After the first year, a student can establish California residency if they are a U.S. citizen. All students are required to have health insurance (which is paid for if you work at least 25% time as a TA). The current cost of health insurance is $3,150 for the academic year. As stated above, historically, the department has been able to provide all of our MFA students who aren’t already receiving tuition/fee remission through central campus fellowships with Teaching Assistant appointments of at least 25% time (approx 10 work hours per week during the quarter) for all registered quarters in the program. Employment as a TA at 25% time or greater provides full in-state tuition remission, as well as remission of most fees (including health insurance.) Additionally, TAs also receive a monthly salary (approximately ~$1250 per month of appointment during the quarter at 25% time. ) More info on student academic employment is available here from the Graduate Division On the Financial Aid website, there is a calculator to determine the total cost of attendance including housing. How many/how to apply for Fellowships? As an applicant to the MFA program you might be considered for a Central Recruitment Fellowship if the Art Department identifies you as a truly outstanding candidate. The department will nominate you, you do not apply for this. Typically, the Central Fellowship will provide fee remission (CA resident fees and possibly out of state fees) and a stipend in the range of $22,000 to $24,000 for your first year. Some fellowships come with a $5000 stipend for the summer. If you have taken the GRE (not required for admission) and have excellent scores, you might choose to submit them as part of your application. Other fellowships that are typically awarded to incoming students may include money from the Department of Art that could be applied to out of state tuition, or given as a stipend. Again, as an applicant, you do not apply for these. How do I find out about Housing? UC Santa Barbara offers a variety of housing options for graduate students. For information on how to apply for housing, please visit Housing and Residential Services. The deadline to apply for housing at San Clemente Villages is May 15th. As long as you have filled out a UCSB Graduate Division online application form, you can apply for university housing, even before you are admitted. You are also welcome to seek housing in the community (in which case, you do not need to submit an application for university-owned housing; see the Community Housing Office for help getting started). What are the Program requirements? Seventy-two quarter units are required: 36 in Graduate Studio courses (Art Studio 244, 261 and 591), 12 units in Theory and Criticism (Art Studio 245 or 594, or approved graduate level theory from related departments), 12 units of M.F.A. Thesis Preparatory (Art Studio 593); and 12 units of electives (related courses selected from various disciplines). Please see the General Catalog more information on specific courses (click on “Course Listings”; all courses numbered 200 or higher are graduate-level courses). During Spring quarter of the first year of residency, graduate students are reviewed by the full faculty through open studio visits, group exhibition and/or presentations (which are augmented by written statements) and a vote is taken regarding advancement to the second year of study. Following their first year of study, graduate students are required to formulate their graduate thesis committee, comprised of 3 members from the Department of Art and university faculty. This committee oversees the completion of the final graduate thesis project as well as the written thesis (25 pages), which is a required document for each student as part of his or her fulfillment of an MFA degree. For more details on the requirements and structure of the program, see the Graduate Handbook . What are the Exhibit and Art world opportunities? There are many opportunities for graduate students to exhibit on campus, in the local arts community and in Los Angeles, through established department connections with arts professionals and a variety of affiliated venues. In fact, many of our recent graduate students have exhibited or are represented by highly respected galleries in California and nationally, further providing an expanding network of future possibilities. Faculty has also been instrumental in bringing our graduates to the attention of curators, in addition to providing a variety of professional opportunities both during candidacy and after graduation. Our job placement in related fields and university programs (including tenure track positions) has been rising steadily over the past five years. What do your Alumni do? Most of our alumni have a professional art career or teach in higher education. From a survey of our alumni taken in 2011, when asked to select all the occupations/positions within the arts in which they have worked since completing their UCSB MFA, 57% indicated they worked as an Educator in Higher Education, 28% indicated Museum or Gallery positions, 26% were Arts Administrators/Managers, and 83% indicate their current occupation/position is in the arts. © 2023 The Regents of the University of California .

The intimate graduate studio community, comprised of 16-20 students each year, is a vital component of the program, providing an active environment for discourse and interchange among students and their peers. The department maintains specialized studio facilities and equipment for experimentation in a range of media. Studio facilities include a woodshop, metalworks foundry, as well as print, paper-making and photography labs. The department also has a comprehensive wing for digital media studies to include a range of research in digital photography, digital video, web interface design, with a specialization in interactive digital environments, a hardware, telecommunications and networks lab. Accessible to graduate students are campus state-of-the-art production and fabrication labs such as the Kerr Hall Instructional Development Center for Media Production, the Physics, Engineering and Geology machine shops for consultation and fabrication. Departmental resources also include a department-sponsored exhibition space, Glass Box Gallery ,  featuring weekly exhibitions by undergraduate and graduate students. Two additional on-campus exhibition venues, The College of Creative Studies Gallery and the Art, Design and Architecture Museum (AD&A Museum) offer exposure to a range of exhibition programming. The AD&A Museum presents major traveling exhibitions and houses a permanent collection for research and presentation purposes. Students are encouraged to explore the possibilities for experimentation given the diverse resources available in a university setting as well as the urban opportunities presented in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Department and Academic Affiliations The Department is closely linked with the UCSB Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) and the AD&A Museum whereby strong collaborations take place in programming and curricular initiatives, bringing distinguished practitioners to campus to participate in exchange forums such as exhibitions, symposia and lecture series. The department’s joint affiliation with the Media Arts and Technology Program (MAT) expands the department’s digital media studies to include interface with cross-campus interdisciplinary programming between the humanities, engineering and computer sciences. The Department of Art is also affiliated with the College of Creative Studies, a small experimental college designed to allow students to rigorously explore a field of knowledge, rather than merely expose them to a predetermined quantity of fixed subject matter. Graduate students are encouraged to take special topic and interdisciplinary coursework offered in it. The Department of Art co-sponsors with the College of Creative Studies the Visual Arts Symposium, which brings prominent artists to campus for public lectures and studio visits with graduate students. The UCSB Arts and Lectures program brings internationally recognized artists and performers to campus through its lecture presentations, poetry readings, performances and film screenings. Students also have an opportunity to participate in the Intercampus Exchange Program for Graduate Students (IEPGS). This program is designed to provide access to courses at other UC campuses not ordinarily available at UCSB. Approvals are required from the Department Chairs and the Graduate Deans on both campuses. IEPGS applications are available on the Graduate Division website. UCSB Research Resources Arts Library The library houses one of the most important collections of exhibition catalogues in the country. It also hosts an artists’ books collection, with works of Ed Ruscha, Laurie Anderson, Adrian Piper and others. The Architecture & Design Collection in the AD&A Museum A growing repository of architectural records containing over 400,000 original drawings as well as specifications, manuscript material, historic photographs, architectural models and furniture.  Included in its holdings are the papers of Rudolph M. Schindler, Gregory Ain, Albert Frey, Kem Weber, Irving J. Gill and Cliff May. Additionally, the collection’s importance derives from its interest in documenting work originally considered to be outside the mainstream of the modern movement. The Image Resource Center This facility consists of over 70,000 digital images and approximately 300,000 35mm slides, which provide comprehensive coverage of Western and non-Western art and architecture.  The IRC catalogue contains images from both the IRC’s own collection as well as images and data from the Archivision digital image library and several other UCSB image collections. Digital assets are available for searching and download to registered users: https://www.vrc.arthistory.ucsb.edu .  The IRC staff can provide assistance with access to the various licensed and free digital image archives available, such as ARTstor, and can assist with implementation of new image technology in teaching. Map and Imagery Laboratory Advances the interdisciplinary use of spatial data and provides technologies for integrating diverse information formats. The facility is nationally recognized for the quantity of spatial data it holds and the availability of equipment for utilizing both analog and digital materials. The California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives (CEMA) A permanent program that advances scholarship in ethnic studies through its varied collections of primary research materials. These unique collections document the lives and activities of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans, Chicanos/Latinos, and Native Americans in California. Historical Sound Recordings Over 250,000 audio recordings are available in a variety of formats. Many of these recordings are unique while many more are commercially issued 78 rpm and cylinder recordings. Other relevant Library special collections include: African American Collections, Asian American Collections, Chicano/Latino Collections, Circus Collections, Environmental Studies Collections, Film and Television Collections, Humanistic Psychology Collections, Music Collections, Native American Collections, Printing and Presses Collections, Religions (American) Collections, Theater Collections, Trade Catalogs and Visual Arts Collections. UCSB Arts & Lectures A place that brings international performances, films, lectures and special events featuring artists, scholars and professionals of all disciplines to the campus. The program also sponsors an Artists-in-Residence series that provides master classes, symposia and classroom engagement with invited professionals from around the world. UCSB is the site for the California Nanosystems Institute and also the Carsey-Wolf Center for research, teaching and public programming about media. This facility maintains state-of-the-art, media research labs and a multi-seat theatre complex for presentations and screenings. © 2023 The Regents of the University of California .
