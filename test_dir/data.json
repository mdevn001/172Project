Our content team, in contrast, runs activities with Semrush without having an army of people specialized in SEO.”|Fabrizio Ballarini|Responsible for SEO, TransferWise|“When it comes to pure value, Semrush wins. That’s mostly because you get a fully-featured SEO software suite AND Google Ads software for the same monthly price.”|Brian Dean|Founder, Backlinko|“We chose Semrush because the keyword tracking was much more accurate than our previous tools and the interface was very intuitive.”|Freddy Hunt|Director of SEO and Content Marketing, Oneupweb|“There is a direct correlation between using Semrush, being focused on SEO, and the sheer growth that we’ve had. Our organic traffic was up by 230% in 2019. Literally every day we are getting the highest traffic ever on our website.”|Eric Bogard|VP of Marketing, Arkadium|“With the help of Semrush, we empowered every single marketing team within the university to double their traffic like we did for the central sites.”|Shefali Joshi|Marketing Optimization Analyst, Monash University|“I’ve never seen a local dental practice in the world ranking as much as we are now. We are ranking nationally. Because of the tool. Simple as that. And I still don’t use even 50% of it.”|Ed Challinor|Co-founder and CEO, Smileworks|“Our overall organic traffic increased sevenfold, with blog traffic making up over 75% of the visits! Semrush allowed us to optimize and run our content strategy without needing an army of SEO experts.”|Barbora Jassova|Content Strategist, Landbot|“Semrush’s SEO Writing Assistant is one of a kind. I was amazed by the feedback and recommendations it provided me to improve my SEO, text readability, originality, and tone of voice.”|Mesmer Doué|Digital Marketing Consultant, Blue Lance|“By using Semrush, my team saves a lot of time by working on the right content and in a more data-driven way.

We actively used Semrush tools in the process to achieve our goals.”|Ilyas Teker|Founder, SEO Consultant, Mosanta|“When you are at the table with a general manager, they just want to know the market share. Market Explorer is the perfect tool to quickly show what our brand’s role and classification inside the market are.”|Emanuele Arosio|Head of Global SEO, Triboo Group|“My favorite part about Semrush is the power it has for competitive intelligence. It makes it easier to make savvy advertising decisions when you have more data.”|Dignorah Altamiranda|Marketing Team Lead, Avature|“I love the feature that lets you analyze the keyword and backlink gap with your competitors. This is very useful in determining which keywords you aren't ranking for, that you could be getting.”|Paul Meluzzo|Creative Director, Omnislash Visual|“Semrush has been pivotal in helping me better understand the competitive landscape of my ad campaigns. I have been able to close the gaps between my organic and paid efforts thus distributing my budget and tactics in a comprehensive manner.”|Andrea Cruz|Digital Marketing Manager, KoMarketing|“My favorite feature is the PPC analysis tool. It tells me what kinds of PPC ads are being run by a specific domain. It is good to optimize my own PPC strategy!”|Vashishtha Kapoor|CoFounder, affNext|“With Semrush, I have found weaknesses in PPC for pitches where I was only covering SEO. I've found clients' new competitors they didn't realise they had and keywords they could target.”|Judith Lewis|Founder, deCabbit Consultancy|“I have used the PPC Keyword Tool to create ads for my clients. And those ads not only fit the client brief, but also have returned great results.”|Ankitaa Gohain Dalmia|Founder, Digital Content Strategist, AnksImage|“Semrush Social Media Toolkit is the best in the business. I’m using this tool to great effect and it has helped to increase my visibility on Social Media.”|Jigar Agrawal|SEO Specialist, freelance|“I’ve been using Semrush for the past 5 years now especially for SEO, content writing, and now even for social media marketing. ”|Himani Kankaria|eCommerce Consultant and SEO Strategist, eComKeeda|“Although it’s not a core function of Semrush I really like their social media posting tool - I would give that a try.”|Trevor Stolber|Founder, STOLBER Digital Marketing Agency|Get started|with Semrush today|Get 7 days of full access to all toolkits.|Cancel anytime.|Start your free trial|USA, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 2475, Boston, MA 02199|Contact us|Change language|English|Español|Deutsch|Français|Italiano|Polski|Português (Brasil)|Tiếng Việt|Türkçe|中文|日本語|한국어|Contact us|USA, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 2475, Boston, MA 02199|Get started with Semrush!|or see our plans & pricing|Semrush|Features|Pricing|Success Stories|Stats and Facts|Insights|News|Custom Report|Help|Knowledge Base|Academy|Semrush API|Community|Semrush Blog|Webinars|More tools|Analytics Reports|Projects|Content Marketplace|Agency Partners|Affiliate Program|SEOquake|Sensor|Tools for Amazon|Prowly|Kompyte|App Center|Company|About Us|Newsroom|Careers|Partners|Legal Info|Privacy Policy|Cookie Settings|Security Info|For Investors|Contact Us|Follow us|Twitter|Facebook|LinkedIn|Instagram|YouTube|Pinterest|Language|English|Español|Deutsch|Français|Italiano|Polski|Português (Brasil)|Tiếng Việt|Türkçe|中文|日本語|한국어|© 2008 - 2023 Semrush.
